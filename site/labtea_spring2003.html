When   thinking     about<br>
                ecosystems and spatial structure, this translates most simply 
  to  the<br>
                level of aggregation or clustering of individuals.&nbsp;
I  will   discuss<br>
                results from spatial simulations I have been running to look
  at  how<br>
                spatial structure affects ecosystem recovery following a
spatially<br>
                spreading disturbance.&nbsp; The amount of clustering in
my  simulations       is<br>
                controlled by the probability that individuals disperse locally 
   versus<br>
                randomly.&nbsp; My results suggest that the amount of random
  dispersal<br>
                interacts with growth rate in determining maximum resilience.&nbsp; 
This   is<br>
                due both to the higher realized birthrate with partial random 
  dispersal<br>
                and to the changes it brings about in the spatial structure.<br>

             (Root) Foraging as a spatial game</font></p>
             
<p><br>
             A bottom-up understanding of plant population biology is complicated 
    by  the<br>
             great flexibility of plant size and shape. This means that models
   based    on<br>
             plants as point s in space are unlikely to reproduce the most
 important      general<br>
             patterns observed in real populations (competition density effect, 
   3/2   or  4/3<br>
             thinning etc.). I've been trying to derive optimal horizintal
 root<br>
             distributions for plants foraging for water, b oth in isolation
  (an<br>
             optimisation problem) and in competition (a game theoretic problem). 
    Some   of<br>
             the results, e.g. that most space should be used exclusively 
by  one   plant<br>
             rather than being shared, should extend to foraging above-ground 
  for   light,   and<br>
             als o to animals that have a spatial location (bird nest, ant
 colony,     fish<br>
             crevices) from which they forage for a spatially diffuse resource.<br>

<div align="left">The diversification of species is an epiphenomenon of many
     important<br>
          processes at the individual and population levels, whose patterns 
 are<br>
          expressed at and above the species level.&nbsp; This confluence 
of  scales    has<br>
          hindered a holistic understanding of this crucial biological process.&nbsp;
I<br>
          shall discuss some of my recent efforts to bridge these scales
by<br>
          analyzing the effects of (traditionally) ecological and evolutionary<br>
          processes on the pattern of phylogenetic tree shape, and discovering<br>
          practical means of detecting and distinguishing between these processes.
     <br>
          I investigate the effects of several models of stochastic extinction,<br>
          including "demographic" (population size fluctuation) and<br>
          "rival-mediated" extinction (through competitive exclusion by or<br>
          hybridization with closely related species).&nbsp; I contrast those<br>
          extinction-affecting processes with a speciation-affecting process
  by<br>
          which "new" species are inhibited from speciating (e.g., through<br>
          suppression by sister species).&nbsp; In describing the phylogenetic
   effects<br>
          of these forces, I simultaneously derive statistics for their detection<br>
          and discrimination, and assess the relative power of these statistics.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The proximate goal is to implement these statistics in SymmeTREE, 
 a<br>
          program that I developed with Brian Moore to detect differential
 rates    of<br>
          diversification using the shape of phylogenies.&nbsp; Assessing 
both   within-<br>
          and between-lineage variation of diversification, SymmeTREE should<br>
          provide a toolbox for understanding the patterns of diversification 
  and<br>
          their probable causes.<br>

        Density dependence, social structure and the emergence of Ebola in<br>
        African apes.</font><br>
        <br>
        The ape Ebola crisis in Congo &amp; Gabon continues to worsen and 
is  now<br>
        burning through the world's highest density gorilla population. In
 this<br>
        talk I will discuss the role that transmission between apes may have<br>
        played in the emergence of Ebola. I will briefly present statistical<br>
        analyses suggesting that Ebola transmission between gorilla in the
 same<br>
        social group is common. These analyses compare the support for alternate<br>
        models of primary and secondary transmission, given survey and<br>
        observational data on gorilla group sizes. This work examines more<br>
        realistic transmission scenarios than presented in my last talk,
using<br>
        Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate likelihoods for alternate models.
  I<br>
        will then discuss a spatially explicit, individual based simulator
 of<br>
        Ebola transmission dynamics that I am developing. I will present<br>
        preliminary results suggesting that Ebola exhibits density dependent<br>
        dynamics in which epidemics can only spread when ape density is above<br>
        some threshold. The model also suggests that ape group size has a 
strong<br>
        effect on Ebola outbreak potential that is independent of population<br>
        density. I'll finish by discussing two ways in which I plan to<br>
        parameterize the model: 1) with data from habituated gorillas and 
chimps,<br>
        and 2) with data from population surveys before, during, and after
 Ebola<br>
        epidemics. The ultimate goal is to use the model as a tool for evaluating<br>
        and optimizing intervention strategies (e.g. vaccination, barrier<br>
        construction, translocation).<br>

 meteorology</font><br>
        <br>
       Concerns regarding the cleanliness and long-term potential of conventional 
   (fossil<br>
       fuel-based) sources of energy have triggered a search for alternatives.
   Windpower has emerged<br>
       as a viable candidate. Operational windfarms already exist in many 
countries.    Several<br>
       environmental issues associated with windfarms have been identified
 and   are being actively<br>
       addressed. Here we used a numerical model to simulate the impact of
 a  large  windfarm on<br>
       atmospheric and land-surface processes over short temporal and spatial 
  scales.  Results show<br>
       that under certain situations, the turbulence generated by windmills 
 can   significantly alter<br>
       the surface wind-speed, humidity and rate of evapotranspiration. Further 
   studies are required<br>
       to investigate whether these effects can become permanent.<br>

       Stoichiometric effects of rising atmospheric CO2 on humans and food
 webs.<br>
      </font><br>
      <br>
        The ongoing increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations 
(CO2),<br>
      stemming largely from fossil fuel burning, is unprecedented in the
history<br>
      of human species.&nbsp; Concerns about the impact of this increase
on  humans  are<br>
      mainly linked to climate change. In this labtea, I will talk about
direct,<br>
      unrelated to climate change, effects of high CO2 on the elemental<br>
      composition (stoichiometry) of plants. Plant products are the foundation
   of<br>
      human nutrition providing the bulk of essential nutrients and 84% of
 calorie<br>
      intake worldwide. Concentrations of several essential elements, such
 as<br>
      iron, iodine, and zinc, in modern crops are insufficient for optimal
 human<br>
      nutrition, thus contributing to the 'hidden hunger' problem that affects<br>
      over the half of human population. Relying on both empirical data and<br>
      modeling, I will argue that elevated CO2 has a potential to alter overall<br>
      plant stoichiometry with likely declines in the levels of essential 
elements<br>
      in plants. Such declines, if not counterbalanced, will intensify the
 already<br>
      acute and widespread problem of micronutrient malnutrition and can
alter    the<br>
      dynamics of natural food webs.<br>

     Climatic influences on chinook salmon demography in the Pacific Northwest<br>
     </font><br>
      <br>
     Chinook salmon of the Pacific Northwest have declined on the whole during<br>
     the past century, yet individual populations exhibit substantial interannual<br>
     variability (and often no clear trend). For the purposes of implementing<br>
     management plans for these fish, an important question is to what extent<br>
     this variability is spatially correlated among populations. It is thought<br>
     that shared climatic forcing could potentially drive such correlations.<br>
     Using maximum likelihood methods, I examine geographic patterns in the<br>
     relationship between historical rainfall and observed salmon counts, 
and<br>
     also explore evidence for regime shifts in marine productivity. Although<br>
     there will be overlap between this talk and my recent departmental seminar,<br>
     I hope to spend more time discussing the particulars of the statistical<br>
     approach and exploring feasible model extensions.<br>

 Dispersal In Discrete-time Metapopulation Models<br>
  </font>    <br>
  This talk is on the role of asynchronous and synchronous<br>
  dispersal in discrete-time matapopulation dynamics where the pre-dispersal<br>
  local patch dynamics are of the same compensatory or overcompensatory<br>
  types. Single-species metapopulation models behave as single-species<br>
  single-patch models whenever all pre-dispersal local patch dynamics are<br>
  compensatory and dispersal is synchronous. However, the dynamics of the<br>
  corresponding metapopulation model connected by asynchronous dispersal<br>
  depends on the dispersal rates. The species goes extinct in at least one<br>
  patch when the asynchronous dispersal rates are high while it persists<br>
  when the rates are low. Metapopulation models with "unstructured"<br>
  overcompensatory pre-dispersal local dynamics connected by synchronous<br>
  dispersal can generate multiple attractors with fractal basin boundaries.<br>
  However, the corresponding models under asynchronous dispersal support<br>
  multiple attractors with smaller numbers of distinct attractors. That is,
 <br>
  dispersal asynchrony can make it easier to determine with absolute<br>
  certainty the set of initial population sizes that lead to each attractor.<br>
  Also, asynchronous dispersal is capable of altering the pre-dispersal<br>
  local patch dynamics from overcompensatory to compensatory dynamics.<br>

   On Perfect Aggregation and Dynamic Clustering</font><br>
      <br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Any biological system has an inherent hierarchy of<br>
   
<div align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; structures, each being subject 
 to modelling. Hence, it can be<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modelled at different scales, or coarse 
graining  levels.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making sure that two different models at
 different scales<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; describe the time evolution of the same 
biological  system can<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be achieved by perfect aggregation, pioneered 
 in ecology in<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the late 80's. A first part of the talk 
will  present this<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tool, and show that it displays several 
nice  mathematical<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; properties, with suggestions it can be
studied  with high<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; level of generality, over a whole biological 
 hierarchy. In a<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; second and more speculative part, a link
 will be sketched<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with so called 'dynamical clustering':
recent  numerical<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; simulations show that for large sets of 
maps  coupled by<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; diffusion on a lattice, clusters of highly 
 correlated cells<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can emerge, such that the whole system
can  be analyzed as a<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spontaneous&nbsp; network of clusters.
These  recent examples<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suggest that perfect aggregation may be 
more  often met in<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; biological systems than what could be spontaneously 
 assumed.<br>

 Population dynamics of cholera and climate<br>
 </font><br>
 <br>
 Cholera is a water-borne infectious disease endemic to Bangladesh and Eastern 
India.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has<br>
 spread from this region to other parts of the worlds and cholera outbreaks 
are synonymous<br>
 with civil strife and the breakdown of water treatment facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In this talk I^&Ograve;ll<br>
 describe some models I have been developing with Mercedes Pascual (Ann Arbor, 
Michigan) that<br>
 look at the interaction between cholera transmission and climate variation.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
There is<br>
 considerable evidence linking cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh to climate, 
yet mechanisms<br>
 explaining this coupling are inconsistent.&nbsp; The models I will describe 
illustrate a subset of<br>
 the subtleties and complexities that arise when we try coupling mechanistic 
models for<br>
 infectious diseases to climate.<br>

Spatially-Explicit Models for the Dynamic Interplay of Land Cover and Soil
<br>
Composition</font><br>
<br>
 Human activities have transformed many forest ecosystems into a mosaic of<br>
forested, degraded, and used lands. The ecosystems which emerge on old<br>
fields and abandoned sites tend to resist reestablishment of pioneer tree<br>
species due to loss of seed viability and low propogule availability. &nbsp;<br>
The regrowth capacity is further depleted in proportion to the type,<br>
intensity, and duration of the previous land use. We will propose a<br>
spatially explicit model for habitat conversion that is motivated by land<br>
cover change in tropical rain forests in Amazonia. This model examines the<br>
landscape level impact of land use activities by utilizing the<br>
interactions between agricultural/industrial use and soil and plant<br>
community dynamics. With concepts from spatial statistics, we will examine<br>
the spatio-temporal patterns that arise from our model.<br>
