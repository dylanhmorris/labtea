allow host jumps?<br>
<p>Considering the broad public and scientific interest in infectious 
disease emergence, surprisingly little work has been done to 
quantitatively describe broad-scale patterns of emergence in light of 
the mechanisms that we believe drive them.  Specific ecological 
processes and pathogen characteristics must affect the probability of 
emergence, and until these factors are recognized we will have little 
predictive power regarding what pathogens are likely to infect species 
other than their current host/s.  Focusing specifically on viruses, I 
will first describe the steps involved in the emergence process and 
discuss several molecular properties that may facilitate spillover.  I 
will then give an example of how these ideas can be tested and used to 
formulate predictive models regarding spillover potential.  Finally, I 
will describe the structure of a database that I am building to 
address questions of emergence potential and, more broadly, of the 
determinants of virus host-range. </p>

variability
of soil moisture in semi-arid ecosystems<br>
<p>Soil moisture is a key hydrological variable that mediates the 
interactions
between climate, soil, and vegetation dynamics in water-limited 
ecosystems.
Because of the importance of water limitation in savannas, a number of
theoretical models of tree-grass coexistence have been developed which
differ in their underlying assumptions about the ways in which trees 
and
grasses access and use soil moisture. However, clarification of the
mechanisms that determine structure of savanna vegetation remains a 
vexing
problem in both hydrological and vegetation science. A particular 
challenge
is the fact that the spatial pattern of vegetation is both a cause and
effect of variation in water availability in semiarid ecosystems. In
particular, at local to landscape scales, the patchy vegetation 
structural
mosaic serves to redistribute the availability of soil moisture in 
ways that
have important consequences for structural dynamics and community
composition. Here I address the role of patchy vegetation structure 
through
the derivation of a landscape-scale model of soil moisture based on 
the
statistics of an underlying poisson distribution of individual tree 
canopies
and their accompanying root systems. The coupling of individual 
pattern to
landscape-scale distribution of soil moisture allows for model 
investigations into the role of tree density, tree size, and canopy 
root
system structure on the spatio-temporal patterns of soil moisture 
dynamics
in savanna ecosystems.</p>

models of quorum sensing by house-moving
ants<br>
<p>In performing collective tasks, social insects often respond to the 
local
number or density of their nest mates, but little is known of how they
~Scount~T one another. When ants of the genus Temnothoraxchoose a new 
home,
their decision relies on scouts who respond to the number of nest 
mates
already at a promising site. At low numbers, they slowly recruit other
scouts to the site, but at high numbers they switch to rapid 
recruitment of
the colony~Rs non-scouting majority. This quorum detection depends on 
a
scout~Rs rate of encounter with nest mates at the site. To explore how 
a
simple cognitive mechanism might use this information, I have adapted 
a
model of two-choice decision-making in humans. Quorum sensing by an
individual ant is modeled as a drift-diffusion process with two 
absorbing
boundaries, corresponding to the decisions that a quorum has, or has 
not,
been attained. When the drift rate is modeled as a saturating function 
of
population, the model effectively replicates the population-dependent
recruitment decisions of real ants, as well as the distribution of 
decision
times for both kinds of recruitment. Next steps are to fit the model 
to
direct measurements of encounter rates, rather than population, and to
determine whether it can predict changes in quorum size as nest area 
(and so
encounter rate) is altered.</p>

patterns and implications for theory
and control<br>
<p>Disease dynamics of multi-host systems have important implications
for public health, livestock husbandry, wildlife conservation and
ecological processes. I explore the infection dynamics of rabies, a
generalist pathogen, during an ongoing outbreak in multi-host
communities of the Serengeti ecosystem. During the last 3 years,
cases of rabies have been recorded in more than 10 species in this
region. Although the vast majority of cases have been domestic dogs,
spatial and temporal clusters of infection in other carnivores
indicate interspecific transmission followed by transient chains of
intraspecific infection. Cross-infection of generalist pathogens such
as rabies is generally assumed to be of little importance to disease
dynamics. However, alternative hosts increase the size of the overall
effective susceptible population and may alter transmission patterns
as well as spatial coupling. Preliminary analysis suggests that
spillover epidemics may act as short-term reservoirs of re-infection,
which can prolong rabies persistence, increase human exposures and
hamper control efforts that target only domestic dog populations.

<p align="left"><font color="#000099">Communities under a 
recruitment-survival tradeoff: building on a dispersal-assembly theory<br>
<p>Some ecologists argue that communities are shaped primarily by 
dispersal and stochastic birth and death events, rather than by niche 
differences between species.  In particular, the recently developed 
"neutral theory" of ecology has had some success at predicting the 
properties of communities from the starting assumption that 
individuals of different species are ecologically equivalent.  It's 
been proposed that this theory works even if individuals differ in 
their traits, as long as they differ along a life-history tradeoff 
that equalizes fitness across individuals of different species.  I 
test this proposal for the simple case of a recruitment-survival 
tradeoff, and find this tradeoff leads to a positive correlation 
between a species' abundance and its per capita recruitment rate (or 
mortality rate, since they are equal under the tradeoff), and to 
higher diversity, more rarity and less dominance than the case of 
ecological equivalence. It also leads to increased variability in a 
species' abundance, and ultimately a shorter time to extinction, with 
increasing vital rates.  I conclude that there are important 
differences between fitness-equalization and ecological equivalence, 
but that the neutral theory of ecology provides a useful framework to 
build on and elucidate how species differences shape stochastic 
variation in the community.  The results presented here are also 
important because the recruitment-survival tradeoff provides an 
alternative to the widely studied competition-colonization tradeoff, 
an alternative that is more realistic for many communities and yields 
the opposite relative abundance predictions. </p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000099">Conflict<br>
<p>I'll be talking about the emergence of conflict within a system that is
selected as a collective (and only as a collective). The work is motivated
by some unexplained observations of animal and human behavior, but it is
done on an abstract level that makes it applicable in general (like
classical game theory is). The work has some interesting implications. For
example, it follows that we can't say, simply by the observation of
conflict, that the observed system involves independently-selected units
(although in many cases of course it does, this inference is not 
necessarily always valid).

Model<br>
<p>We will be looking at how impulses affect the following discrete
Beverton-Holt fisheries model.
</p><p>
X(n+1) = AX(n)/(1+BX(n))
</p><p>
Usually, the above difference equation converges very quickly to its
equilibrium. In our version of the model, we allow periodic
harvesting. Impulses model this harvesting of the fish.
</p><p>
X(1) = AX(0)/(1+BX(0))
</p><p>
X(2) = AX(1)/(1+BX(1))
</p><p>
X(3) = AX(2)/(1+BX(2))
</p><p>
X(4) = AX(3)/(1+BX(3))
</p><p>
Every fourth year we allow, say, sixty percent of the fish to be
harvested with an additional 10 sent to the EPA for testing. Hence we
have
</p><p>
X_plus(4) = (1 - 0.60)X(4) - 10 
</p><p>
We use the impulsed population to determine the fish population the
next year.
</p><p>
X(5) = AX_plus(4)/(1 + BX_plus(4))
</p><p>
We continue the model in this fashion.
</p><p>
Some questions that arise include, "How much fishing should we
allow and how often to avoid killing off all the fish in the pond?"
and "How much time is required to allow the fish population to reach
equilibrium?"
</p><p>
Also, if there is time, we shall look at the impulsive version
of E.C. Pielou's discrete delay equation
</p><p>
X(n+1) = AX(n)/(1 + BX(n-k))
</p><p>
The delay of "k" years in the model allows the possibility of
oscillations and periodic behavior to occur.

forests <br>
<p>In the first part of the talk I will present results from a
meta-analysis where I show (1) that there are striking differences in the
fire regimes between the boreal forests of North America and Eurasia (i.e.
it burns more often in Eurasia and fires are less severe), (2) that this
can be explained by the fire adaptation strategies of the dominating tree
species, and (3) why this has important consequences for biome-scale
carbon dynamics. In the second part I will focus on fire-vegetation
interactions in Siberian forests and ask how changes in burn frequency may
alter successional pathways and cause a switch between alternate stable
states (light versus dark taiga). To answer this question I have
parameterized the forest simulator SORTIE for Siberian tree species and
added a fire and fuel production model. I will briefly introduce the main
model components and how they were parameterized from a wide array of
field data. Although this is work in progress I might dare to show some
premature first model results.

Ecosystem Service Haloes: Patterns of Propagation
<br>
<p>
As we enter the twilight of de novo reserve creation, the need is
intensifying for theory to help optimize our ecosystem management and
restoration efforts. I present preliminary work and early thinking in
this area, emphasizing spatial and dynamic contexts. The challenge is
to understand the interaction among diverse, sometimes conflicting,
objectives that must be considered in an effective management
program. The goals which I have begun pondering are:
population/species persistence, maintenance of ecosystem services,,
learning/information, and resilience. I will address some inchoate
thoughts on these goals, and present the model described below.
</p>
<p>Researchers have begun asking how to optimally manage ecosystems with
the goal of maintaining their economically tractable services. There
have been some recent stimulating studies that have demonstrated
interesting empirical properties of service haloes around patches of
natural landscape. If proximity to natural land increases the
benefits of certain services, we'll see some interesting landscape
patterns among stakeholders and their land-use strategies. The
situation is further complicated by the fact that the diverse suite
of services will likely have different propagation (e.g., that of
erosion, pollination, or water quality). The challenge is to properly
incentivize conservation for stakeholders, given their spatially
contingent interactions with resources - a dilemma with significant
consequences for the fate of comanagement and community management. I
have formulated a simple toy model which considers static, spatial
incentives for stakeholders in artificial landscapes, in the form of
service haloes around natural landscape patches. I will present
preliminary descriptive results regarding the role of the pattern of
fragmentation and the scale of property rights, with the goal of
getting input on future directions.

intraspecific variation in a simple model of plant
competition
<br>
<p>Interspecific tradeoffs lead to multi-species coexistence in a variety
of
models, and empirical studies support the existence of such tradeoffs.
Jim
Clark et al. (2003) used super-duper Bayesian hierarchical modeling to
show
that traditional statistical analyses underestimate intraspecific
variation,
and, therefore, overestimate interspecific differences in growth rates.
They conclude that (1) species are not as different from each other as we
typically assume, and (2) the broad overlap in growth rates between
competing species implies a more prominent role for stochastic drift and a
less prominent role for interespecific tradeoffs than most people, besides
Steve Hubbell, presently believe.  Using a simple two-species model of
plant
competition, I will show that these conclusions are not generally correct.
I examine a model in which two species have the same fecundity (per-adult
seed production) but differ in their distributions of seed quality.  When
fecundity is high, the species with the highest potential seed quality
always wins (i.e., it always persists, while the other species always goes
extinct), even if the two distributions of seed quality are nearly
identical.  In contrast, when fecundity is low, the two species have about
the same chance of winning, even if the distributions of seed quality are
non-overlapping.  I will also show that, depending on the fecundity, a
species whose distribution of seed qualities has a relatively high mean
but
low variance can beat, get beaten by, or coexist with a competing species.
I apologize to anyone has read this entire abstract.  I did not intend for
it to be so long.

Within-species (genetic) diversity is important in a wide range of

diversity
is necessary for their survival in the face of environmental changes and
disease. For pathogens, diversity plays an important role in their
population dynamics and control. In this talk I will show that genetic
diversity is distributed unevenly. Using simple genealogical models, I
show
that genetic distinctiveness has a power-law distribution. This property
implies that much of the diversity is concentrated in small
sub-populations.
These theoretical results agree with genetic data on the distribution of
diversity in global samples of Pseudomonas bacteria. I will also present a
new method of estimating the genetic diversity of a population from a
sample. Finally, I show that the total genetic diversity in a population
depends strongly on the size of its habitat, much more strongly than does
biodiversity as measured by the number of species.

coastal social-ecological systems<br>
<p>Humans impact almost every aspect of ecological systems, and threaten
the continued production of valued ecosystem services. Forecasting how
human activities alter the structure and functioning of ecosystems, and
thus the production of ecosystem services, is fundamentally a biological
problem. But biology alone will not be sufficient as ecological and
social systems are coupled. In particular, we must better understand the
responses of coupled social-ecological systems to disturbance.
Resilience (i.e. the amount of disturbance that a system can withstand
before its structure and functioning change significantly) theory and
related concepts (robustness, vulnerability, adaptive capacity) have the
potential to contribute to more effective coastal marine management and
conservation. Core research questions include: What are the important
variables, linkages, and drivers of change that define coupled coastal
systems? What are the sources of resilience in these coupled systems? I
will introduce how the developing knowledge of resilience can be applied
to advance sustainability at the regional scale, by focusing on the
coupled social-ecological systems of Chesapeake Bay.

<p align="left"><font color="#000099">A critique of how game theory is
used; based on models of conflict and cooperation <br>
<p>
Game theoretical models in behavioural ecology often make simplifying
assumption without thought as to their consequences.  It is usually
assumed that the choice of action by contestants is simultaneous. In other
words individuals ignore others in making their choice. This assumption
not only conflicts with empirical evidence, but crucially affects the
outcome of the game. I argue that we need instead to carefully model the
process (over time) by which decisions are reached.  Model often ignore
differences between individuals. It may seem that this simplifying
assumption is innocuous when differences are not large, but differences
can fundamentally change the nature of a game.  Finally, theoretical
analyses of extensive form games usually assume that individuals are
completely flexible and can always take the best action given circumstance
(subgame perfection). Restricting flexibility can again fundamentally
change predictions. All these three point are inter-related and will be
illustrated by simple games involving conflict and cooperation. </p>
