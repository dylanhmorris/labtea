<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The New World army ant, E. burchelli, is
a diurnal swarm raiding species that forages in huge raids of up to 200,000
individuals.&nbsp; Although decades of study have revealed much of the
behavioral biology and ecology of army ants, little is known of the fundamental
behavioral mechanisms underlying the exquisite coordination and organization
achieved by these ants in their raiding and nomadic behavior.&nbsp; For
anyone with an interest in self-organization and complex systems, watching
100,000 ants foraging effectively together without centralized control
is enough to make one move to Costa Rica permanently (wait until you see
the pictures of thousands of army ants consuming a huge cockroach alive).</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although there has been extensive work
on E. burchelli at BCI (Panama) and Corcovado (Costa Rica), very little
research on these ants has taken place at La Selva (Costa Rica).&nbsp;
I'll present an overview of past field and modeling work on E. burchelli.&nbsp;
Then I'll discuss the results of my field work this summer on E. burchelli

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">[<a href="#schedule">back to schedule</a>]</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A mathematical model for cell movement
in multicellular systems has been developed that allows us to simulate
and visualize, in three dimensions, individual cell movements in a number
of multicellular</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">systems. These include cell movement during,
aggregation and slug stage, of {\it Dictyostelium discoideum}, embryogenesis,
limb formation and wound healing.&nbsp; The building blocks of the model
are</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">individual cells, and each cell has certain
given properties. The basic properties are that a cell deforms under force
(either stretch or compress), while conserving its volume, it adheres to
other cells and it can generate an active motive force. The response of
a cell depends on its internal parameter state, and on the information
it receives from its external environment, which includes neighbor cells,
the extracellular matrix and chemical signals.&nbsp; The movement and deformation
of each cell is then determined by summing up all the forces that a cell
experiences from its surroundings, and using that force in the equations
of motion.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Here I introduce this model and and show
examples of its applications and compare the results with experimental
data. Among the simulations I show, is how different cell types can sort
out based solely on</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">differences in adhesion. The results are
compared to cell sorting experiments done by Steinberg {\it et al}~\cite{Steinberg63,Foty96}
using values for adhesion within the range of the experimental values.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also present results from simulations
of {\it Dictyostelium} movements.&nbsp; First I show simulations of the
aggregation stage, where cells are aggregating chemotactically, towards
a signaling center, in response to cAMP waves. In these simulations one
can observe stream formation and how the mound arises due to the inward
motion of the cells towards the signaling center. I will also present simulations
of 2-D slugs, where where I studied the affect cell adhesion and cell chemotaxis
have on the soring of Prespore and Prestalk cells in the slug. These findings
will be compared to observations of 2-D slugs done by Bonner~\cite{bonner98}.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">While local interactions can have a strong
influence on the large scale porperties of ecosystems, ecological models
often include physical disturbance as an imposed source of variability
that is not allowed to interact with biotic processes at the local scale.
In intertidal communities dominated by mussels, wave disturbances create
gaps in the mussel bed that recover through a succession from empty space
to oportunistic species (barnacles and macroalgae), and mussel bed. I present
a grid-based simulation of mussel disturbance dynamics as a generic forest
fire model (FFM). The model allows local interactions among discrete successional
stages defined by aggregating individuals and species into community elements.
I first describe the case where each cell of the lattice can be empty,
occupied by a mussel bed element, or ``burning'' which corresponds to a
newly disturbed cell having unstable edges. The FFM is generalized by allowing
global and local (density-dependent) transition rules. I compare the large
scale properties of the simulation with field data from 6 sites along the
Oregon coast.&nbsp; Although the dynamics of both natural data and the
simulation can show very different behaviors, I look for constrained behaviors
in field data that are also observed in the simulation and explained by
the geometry of local interactions and by percolation thresholds. The simulation
including intermediate stages and a mean-field approximation are also presented.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Field data suggest that savannas are patch-dynamic
systems composed of many patches (a few hectares in size) in different
states of transition between grassy and woody dominance. Following this
hypothesis, locally and temporally favorable conditions can lead to the
conversion of patches of open savanna into bush encroached thickets. However,
over many decades, growth, inter-bush competition, and mortality may transform
these thickets back into open savanna. In arid savannas, the conversion
of patches of open savanna into bush encroached thickets might simply be
driven the spatiotemporal rainfall distribution.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">[<a href="#schedule">back to schedule</a>]</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although fractals have for long been applied
in ecology, multifractals have, in contrast, received little attention.
In this work we explore the application of the multifractal formalism to
the power law form of the species-area relationship. The generalization
of the power law species-area relationship by multifractal methods is potentially
far reaching: it ties species-area theory to a number of indices used widely
to quantify diversity, generates a number of new hypotheses about patterns
of biodiversity for further investigation, and it develops new tools with
utility in addressing practical issues, such as, conservation.&nbsp; While
fractal sets are described in terms of a single number (the fractal dimension),
multifractals require an infinite number of “dimensions”, usually called
a spectrum. The characterization of multifractals can be obtained by two
different approaches: the method of moments and the method of histograms.
The former deals with the statistical moments of the species abundance
distribution, but can only be applied when the moments exhibit power law
scaling with area. The latter method is of more general application and
uses histograms of the species abundance distribution obtained at different
areas. The method of moments shows that the power law form of the species
area relationship, and the Shannon, Simpson, and Berger-Parker diversity
indices belong to a family of equations relating the species number, species
relative abundance and area through the moments of the species abundance
distribution. Explicit formulas for these diversity indices, as a function
of area, are derived. In addition, the method of moments implies relationships
between a species range and its relative abundance. The method of histograms
highlights the dependence of the shape of the species relative abundance
distribution on area. The application of these methods is illustrated with
data on tree and shrub species collected in a 50 ha plot in the Barro Colorado
Island, Panama. Results from the method of moments show that some moments
of the species abundance distribution have power law scaling with the area.
Results from the method of histograms show that after appropriate transformation
the species abundance distributions obtained at different areas converge
to a single curve: the multifractal spectrum.</font>

exploration of variance in models and data</font></font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Coral reef fish populations vary greatly
through space and time. Data collected through long-term censuses and from
biological responses to experimental manipulations reveal that the variability
of reef fish communities has definite pattern and structure. Therefore,
to elucidate ecological patterns structuring reef fish populations, it
is imperative for the researcher to use variance as a source of information
and not simply as a source of error. I have developed a series of models
describing the propagation of recruitment variability into adult fish populations.
Variance propagation is estimated by linearizing a set of coupled population
equations and decomposing the spectrum of the output variance. Patterns
of mortality, predation, and foraging each affect the characteristics of
the resultant demographic variability in qualitatively different ways.
I compared predictions derived from the model with data from our field
studies and from the literature. This comparison suggests a prevalence
of predator-mediated regulation among reef fish populations. I find predators
to be most important in regulating population numbers while density dependent
growth and other intraspecific interactions are dominant in regulating
population biomass. Such decoupling of variability in population numbers
and biomass highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate response
variable when searching for evidence of specific ecological processes.</font>

effectively reduces the cost of competition. Vertical spatial structure
in every ecosystem is dominated by the ever-present influence of gravity
and the fact that solar energy comes from above. This predictability of
vertical spatial structure has allowed organisms to adapt to exploit particular
regions of vertical space, e.g. canopy vs. under story trees, deep vs.
shallow rooted plants, etc. I am developing a model to explore the significance
of plant strategies for mining soil water and allocating resources between
the below and aboveground environments. I defined 4 plant functional types,
based on allocation and root strategies: Above-Shallow, Above-Deep, Below-Shallow,
and Below-Deep. I ran contests between these types under wet, mesic, and
dry climates, to try to understand the mechanisms by which each type can
succeed or fail in each environment. I am also trying to write the equations
for the model. Since I am dealing with two distinct time scales (annual
and daily), integro-difference equations seemed appropriate: the annual-scale
variables follow difference equations that have components that integrate
over the daily time scale. The hard part is that the daily time scale also
needs to integrate over the vertical spatial structure. I will present
the equations, and hope for enlightening comments and suggestions from
the audience.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By modelling demography and the evolution

recently suggested that gene flow across an environmental gradient could
inhibit adaptation away from the center of a species’ distribution, and
lead to the formation of a range boundary despite the species’ genetic
potential to adapt to more extreme conditions.&nbsp; My own work yields
closely similar results while eliminating assumptions about the distribution
of phenotypes in populations, and the pattern of phenotypic or genotypic
variance in space.&nbsp; Furthermore, my model seems to predict decreased
variance within marginal populations.&nbsp; The cost of this added power
is the need to track phenotypic classes individually, instead of population
attributes.&nbsp; This in turn requires new assumptions about patterns
of phenotypic inheritance, but there is promise for relaxing these in the

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The brown tree snake, Boiga irregularis,
is an exotic invasive predator that has caused major ecological and economic
damage on the Pacific island of Guam.&nbsp; In the absence of natural enemies
and with a wide and vulnerable prey base, brown tree snakes reached phenomenal
densities and have caused the extinction of most native forest birds on
Guam.&nbsp; Current snake control measures such as barrier fences, trapping
and chemical controls are expensive and largely ineffective. Biological
control using parasites or pathogens is an alternate approach to regulate
B. irregularis that can be used alone or in combination with other measures.&nbsp;
Our objectives were to develop a simple mathematical model that describes
the population biology of brown tree snakes on Guam, and to assess the
potential of different types of pathogens to regulate snake abundance.
We also surveyed known reptile parasites to identify potential biocontrol
agents and characterize their transmission, virulence, and host specificity.&nbsp;
We then modified our basic model to incorporate the features of three broad
