<br><p>There is a lot of excitement now around a potential pandemic of a 
new
flu strain. It may seem that the currently circulating strains are not
of concern anymore. Unfortunatly, this is not the case. My talk is
about the evolution (also refered to as the 'antigenic drift') of the
H3N2 and H1N1 flu subtypes that are still around in the human
population. I will explain how I am trying to study the drift using
clustering techniques, what potential benefits and pitfalls this
approach has and what rather puzzling observations it allows to make.

<p align="left"><font color="#000099"> Dynamical consequences of repeated 
pathogen introduction and implications for control
<br><p>Host-pathogen systems are well understood from a theoretical 
perspective, and the phenomenon of a rapidly-spreading pathogen 'burning 
itself out' by quickly depleting the susceptible population after its 
initial introduction is well known.  Reintroduction of the pathogen into a 
population following an initial epidemic will produce dynamics distinct 
from the initial introduction into a naïve population, and I will use a 
simple SIR model to show that repeated introductions can be considered a 
special case of a well-understood type of dynamical behavior.  We will see 
that reintroduction of a pathogen into a partially immune population 
produces epidemics with smaller peaks but extended duration, which may 
facilitate spread to surrounding populations.  I will explore the 
consequences of this change in dynamics between initial and subsequent 
introductions by showing that this change may have been pivotal in the 
spread of Nipah virus in peninsular Malaysia in 1999.  Finally, I will 
discuss the implications of these dynamics for designing Nipah virus 
prevention and control strategies. </p> <p>[<a

<p align="left"><font color="#000099"> Crown shape and competition for 
canopy space
<br><p>The structure of the forest canopy is crucial to the dynamics and 
functioning of forests, both because it determines the understory light 
environment, which in turn determines population dynamics; and because it
determines the growth rates of canopy trees, which in turn determines 
carbon
fluxes and storage. Current models of forest canopies are inadequate,
because they do not capture the most fundamental aspect of tree growth,
namely that trees are plastic in their growth and so compete for, and 
fill,
all the available space in the canopy. A couple of years ago I began to 
try
to provide a model formulation that would capture this plastic growth. 
Ever
since, this apparently esoteric and  highly applied project has continued 
to
suggest much deeper and broader implications, largely because of the work 
of
others in the Pacala lab (including Steve himself). I'll try to explain
what it is about this modeling effort that I've found so exciting: the
fact that the model formulation was worked out by foresters 40 years ago,
but that none of them thought to tell the broader ecological community; 
that
it is mathematically
 identical to the latest and greatest formulation for below-ground
competition arrived at by plant ecologists only recently; that
(counter-intuitively) its greater biological realism makes it easier to
implement and possible analyze mathematically; that it leads it to a
ridiculously simple mathematical technique to predict the long-term 
dynamics
of forest IBMs without modeling any individuals; and the fun (and 
heartache)
I've had parameterizing the model for every species in the US, via the
powerful (but occasionally troublesome) hierarchical Bayesian methods that
we heard about from Jeremy last week. It will be interesting to see 
whether
any of you come to share any of this enthusiasm, or whether I just have an
unhealthy obsession with virtual trees.

<p align="left"><font color="#000099"> Hierarchical Bayesian analysis of 
tree 
allometries
<br>
<p>Hierarchical statistical models allow us to estimate parameters for 
entities
(e.g., species) for which we have little data, or even no data at all, 
if
there is a known hierarchical (e.g., phylogenetic) relationship among 
the
entities.  If closely related species for which we do have lots of 
data have
similar parameter values, then we might expect the same to be true for 
the
data-poor species.  Hierarchical modeling provides a framework for
quantifying the preceding sentence.
I will present analyses of height and leaf mass as a function of 
diameter
for all 339 tree species recognized by the US Forest Service inventory
program.  Tree height is relatively easy to measure, there are lots of 
data
for lots of species, and the analysis works quite nicely.  In 
contrast, most
forest researchers are not keen on blowing an entire day just to weigh 
the
leaves of a single tree, and those who do attempt this foolish 
enterprise
are not very good at it.  So, the data are few and crappy, and the 
analysis
is a mess. This is where the Bayesian part comes in.  If you choose 
the
right Bayesian priors, you can get some very sweet looking results, 
which
admittedly is troubling.  
I am hoping to conclude with an open discussion about the pros and 
cons of
Bayesian analysis, but this will require that you hang on my every 
word as I
try to explain what I did and why.

Networks
<br>
<p>
This paper studies the problem of spreading a product (an idea,
cultural fad or technology) among agents in a social network. An
agent obtains the product with a probability that depends on the
spreading rate of the product as well as on the behavior of the
agent's neighbors. This paper shows, using a mean field approach,
that there exists a threshold for the spreading rate that
determines whether the product spreads and becomes persistent or it
does not spread and vanishes. This threshold depends crucially on
the connectivity distribution of the network and on the mechanism
of diffusion.

deforestation
<br>
<p>We develop an agent-based model for deforestation to explore how agents 
make
decisions associated with deforestation and how these decisions come to
influence macro patterns of land-use over time. We assume that a forest is
composed of many land parcels arranged in a regular square lattice in a
one-dimensional space. Each parcel is in either a forested or a deforested
state. When utilities of forested and deforested states are given,
landowners make a decision to increase the net present value of their 
land.
The net present value of the land is the weighting average of the current
utility and the utility to be received in a future. By analyzing 
equilibrium
patterns, we show that when landowners largely discount the future
utilities, the deforestation rate is very high and an entire forest 
becomes
to be deforested. We give the exact condition representing when
deforestation occurs, and show that the condition is independent of the
landowner's expectation on deforestation rate occurring in a future.

Ideal free 
distribution models are commonly employed by both 
theoreticians 
and empiricists to predict distributions of animals in patchy 
environments.  These models have undergone nearly constant development and 
extension since their original formulation over three decades ago, with 
the 
result that there are now myriad variations whose predictions have not 
been 
rigorously tested.  I will show how a payoff structure that is common to 
many ideal free distribution models causes such models to make predictions 
that are paradoxical (and erroneous) for certain empirical 
situations.  These predictions arise because many of the models lack 
sufficient variables to encapsulate natural kinds of variation in 
patches.  A simple revision of the common payoff structure eliminates the 
erroneous predictions, and I provide empirical data that strongly support 
the proposed revision.

grassland community structure in California<br>
<p> Our project seeks to develop a general, dynamic mathematical 
theory of
vector-transmitted pathogen spread in multi-host communities that 
explicitly
incorporates the abiotic context. Using barley yellow dwarf virus 
(BYDV), we
will build a theory based on a bottom up understanding of how 
anthropogenic
environmental change might affect pathogen dynamics and their host
communities, complementing much current research in human and animal
systems.  We will independently both parameterize and test 
mathematical
models on this pathogen system.  Preliminary model predictions suggest 
that
BYDV may currently be a key species affecting the community dynamics 
of
California grasslands. Thus we plan on elucidating how perennial and 
annual
grasses are differentially effect, and are affected by, pathogen 
dynamics.
We will also experimentally examine several sets of sub-communities in 
the
field that closely match communities of general theoretical interest, 
and
also replicate our tests across multiple phylogenetic lineages.  By 
using
these multiple lineages, we can better understand how these life 
history
traits affect pathogen dynamics and community structure.  By using 
these
sets of sub-communities, we will be able to test how well model 
predictions
and experimental results match, strengthening the basis for using
mathematical model to understand how pathogens affect communities.  We 
will
also examine how vector preference for different hosts, and dependence 
on
different hosts, may vary seasonally and effect pathogen dynamics, and 
thus
community structure.
