a<br>         casual presentation on some of his previous work related to stability<br>         properties of dynamical systems, and introduce the background and several<br>         framework models for a project related to the Yellowstone to Yukon  (Y2Y)<br>         conservation initiative.<br> <br>         After making a closer analysis of the classical stability / complexity<br>         relationships put forth by May, it was surprising to find that one  of  the<br>         simplest dynamical models (the multi-species Lotka-Volterra system)   exhibits<br>         quite different behavior.&nbsp; In fact, stability is shown forthis    example   to<br>         increase with greater complexity measured in terms of (high levels  of)<br>         connectance.&nbsp; This observation led to a closer study of "compartmentalized"<br>         food webs, and "compartmentalization" has been found to increase a  wide<br>         variety of stability measures.&nbsp; Then considering more complex  dynamical<br>         models, namely multiple stable states, a statistical test has been  developed<br>         to determine if time series exhibit this dynamical property. These  3<br>         subjects will be briefly touched upon.<br> <br>         Practical reserve design is a problem plagued by poor quality data  and<br>         political infighting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over this past summer, a preliminary    analysis  for<br>         the possibilities of successful reserve design was carried out for  the<br>         northern Rocky Mountains. The northern Rocky Mountain ecosystemand   some   of<br>         the background politics will be introduced, along with the directions    of<br>         current conservation efforts. Given this background I will propose  several<br>         possible directions that conservation, through reserve design, can  proceed<br>         and look forward to comments from the audience.</p> <center></center> <div align="Left"> <div align="Justify"> <center></center> <br> </div> <center></center> </div> <hr><br> <a name="Walsh"></a> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wednesday, January 23</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica">               @ 2 pm</font> <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">                    Peter Walsh</font></font></font></b></p> <p>Large Scale Elephant Eanging and Tree Dynamics in a Congo Forest<br> <br>         Large vertebrate species are in the midst of a precipitous worldwide<br>         decline. Particularly hard hit are the tropics, where a boomingbushmeat<br>         industry has left many forests structurally intact but devoid of large<br>         animals. An urgent question is, then, whether these ^empty^ forests   can<br>         sustain their species diversity in the long term. Can smaller species<br>         easily compensate? Or, do larger vertebrates tend to be critical to   the<br>         functioning of tropical forest communities?<br> <br>         Answers to these questions may lie in the role of large vertebrates   as<br>         seed predators. Tropical trees display two contrasting strategies for<br>         escaping predation. "Mast" fruiting species set seed at long intervals    to<br>         depress predator population size and highly synchronously to satiate<br>         predators alive at the time of seed set. Other species escape in space,<br>         dispersing their seed widely so that seeds and seedlings are either   too<br>         far from conspecifics for host-specific pathogens and predatorsto   find   or<br>         too rare for generalist predators to profitably search for. Many spatial<br>         escape species even convert potential predators into mutualistsby<br>         providing a fruit reward in return for seed dispersal. Here I argue   that   a<br>         major axis of competition in tropical forests may be between the guild    of<br>         spatial escape trees that cooperate to maintain populations of their<br>         shared seed dispersers and the guild of time escape trees that seek   to<br>         suppress predators that include the seed dispersers of their spatial<br>         escape competitors. Vertebrate body size may influence this competition<br>         through its affect on ranging scale, with larger animals both providing<br>         spatial escape trees a suite of long distance dispersal advantages  and<br>         acting as particularly efficient seed predators.</p> <p>In this talk I will present data collected in Northern Congo supporting     an<br>         effect of vertebrate ranging scale on tree dynamics. In particular,   I  will<br>         show that:<br>         1)Elephants disperse large quantities of seed from many tree species   over<br>         unprecedented distances.<br>         2)Elephant dispersed species are less aggregated in space than species<br>         dispersed by other animals, wind, or gravity.<br>         3)Similarity in species composition decays less rapidly in space for<br>         elephant dispersed species than for other species.<br>         4)Within species fruiting synchrony shows a different pattern of spatial<br>         autocorrelation in elephant dispersed species than other species.<br> <br>         If Josh let^s me get this far, I will then briefly discuss plans for   a<br>         coupled tree-animal model that will be used to examine how removal  of<br>         large vertebrate species will affect the stability of tropical forest<br>         communities.</p> <hr><br> <a name="Juan"></a> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wednesday, February 13</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica">              @ 2 pm</font> <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">                    Juan Keymer</font></font></font></b></p> <p>Adaptive dynamics and particle mechanics:<br>         Is the Mean-field an ESS?<br> <br>         I will be talking about the unit of selection problem and fitness measures<br>         in spatially explicit models as well as evolutionary game theory and   its<br>         relationships (assumptions about genetic architectures) with adaptive<br>         dynamics of continuous traits. These traits (fecundity, mortality,  and<br>         dispersal) specify the rules of particle mechanics of evolving agents<br>         playing the "space-time-capture" game (preemtive competition for space).<br>         The topology of spatio-temporal interactions is evolved among strategies<br>         otherwise equivalent (same R0) under mean-field settings. In these  cases,<br>         the nature of the "interactors" (in the sense of Hull) lead some authors<br>         (van Baalen and Rand) to define eigenvectors or pair-densities as "the<br>         unit of selection". In the model I consider however, interaction takes<br>         place at multiple timescales (making the pair approximation to break-down)<br>         and thus the unit of selection (or interaction) becames dilutedamong<br>         those scales--Indeed the spatio-temporal scales of interaction are<br>         themselves evolving. The role of multiple scale pair-approximations   is<br>         discussed to derive fitness measures and detect units of evolutionary<br>         activity at multiple scales.<br>         &nbsp; </p> <hr> <p><br> <a name="Chan"></a> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wednesday, February 20</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica">                    @ 2 pm</font></p> <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">                    Kai Chan</font></font></font></b></p> <center> <div align="Left">Phylogenies--as histories of the divergence of lineages--provide     a wealth<br>         of information critical to the study of diversification.&nbsp; Variation     in<br>         rates of diversification between lineages leaves characteristicpatterns<br>         in phylogenies: asymmetric distributions of species among lineages,   and<br>         skewed distributions of branch lengths (periods between diversification<br>         events).

We use adetailed<br>        model of plant photosynthesis and water transport to explore howdifferent<br>        trait combinations determine different summary water use features. Then    we<br>        analize the effect of different trait combinations on the probabilistic<br>        structure of soil moisture, assimilation and transpiration (i.e pdf,<br>        means). <br> <br>        Work done in collaboration with Edoardo Daly and Ignacio R-Iturbe.<br> <br> </p> <hr> <p><a name="Sumpter"></a> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wednesday, March 27</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica">                    @ 2 pm</font></p> <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">             David Sumpter</font></font></font></b></p> <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">                    TBA</font></font></font></b><br>                    &nbsp; </p> <hr> <p>&nbsp;<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wednesday, April 3 </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica">                    @ 2 pm</font></p> <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">                    Ben Strauss</font></font></font></b></p> <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">                    TBA</font></font></font></b><br>                    &nbsp;</p> <hr> <p><a name="Webb"></a> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wednesday, April 10</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica">                    @ 2 pm</font></p> <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">                Colleen Webb</font></font></font></b></p> <b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">                    TBA</font></font></font></b> <hr><br> <p><a name="Glenn"></a> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wednesday, April 17</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica">                    @ 2 pm</font></p> <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">         Glenn Adelson</font></font></font></b></p> <b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">         Axes of Diversity<br> <br> </font></font></font></b>"'Diversity' is a term with no essential philosophical,  political, or aesthetic content."<br> <br>   The purpose of my talk is to explore whether Menand could have added "scientific"  to his list, and if the<br>   answer is "yes," what are the implications for biodiversity studies and conservation?<br> <br>   My initial response is that the answer is, in fact, "yes," but that such  an answer opens up as opposed to<br>   closes off useful discussion of diversity in biology.&nbsp; Diversityhas   no essential scientific content<br>   because there are too many kinds of diversity, which I will call axesof   diversity, and only after you<br>   choose which axis --&nbsp; species richness, structural diversity, genetic  diversity within populations,<br>   genetic diversity between populations, taxonomic dispersion, etc, -- that  you can begin to provide<br>   content. <br> <br>   An interesting aspect of the conceptualization of diversity in this manner  is that you notice that it is<br>   often the case that when diversity increases on one axis, it decreases on  another.&nbsp; A well-known example<br>   is that when genetic diversity between populations increases, it can often  be the direct result of<br>   genetic diversity within populations decreasing.&nbsp; I will providea number  of examples like this, and ask<br>   how we can formalize the increase and decrease in diversity, especially with  an eye toward conservation.<br> <hr> <p><a name="Irakli"></a> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wednesday, April 24</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica">                    @ 2 pm</font></p> <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">          Irakli Loladze</font></font></font></b></p> <b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">                    TBA</font></font></font></b> <hr> <p><a name="Lora"></a> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wednesday, May 15</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica">                    @ <font color="#ff0000">12:30 pm</font></font></p> <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">       Lora Billings</font></font></font></b></p>       Noise Induced Chaos in the SEIR model<br> <br>   Population models are fascinating dynamical systems which capture all<br>   ranges of behavior, from periodic to chaotic time series. The SEIR model<br>   is a commonly used base model to predict epidemic outbreaks in many<br>   diseases. Our work identifies the global mechanism to induce chaos by<br>   stochastic perturbations, or population noise, where chaos does not<br>   naturally occur. This mechanism combines both random fluctuations and<br>   global topology to create a stochastic version of a heteroclinic<br>   connection of the system. To refine the possibility of epidemic control,<br>   we then identify the stochastic transport between basins.
