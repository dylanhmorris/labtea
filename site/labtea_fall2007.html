<p align="left"><font color="#000099">The evolution of quorum sensing in
bacterial biofilms<br>
</font>
<p><font color="#000099">Microbes have fascinating and diverse social lives.
They display coordinated group behaviors regulated by quorum-sensing systems
that detect the density of other bacteria around them. A key example of
bacterial group behavior is biofilm formation, in which communities of cells
attach to a surface and envelope themselves in secreted polymers.
Interestingly, some bacterial species activate polymer secretion at high cell
density, while others do the opposite. Here we use detailed individual-based
simulations to investigate evolutionary competitions between strains that
differ in their polymer production and quorum-sensing phenotypes. We focus
upon the counterintuitive case: why would bacteria that secrete polymer in
biofilms terminate its production at high cell densities, when high cell
densities are a characteristic feature of the biofilm phenotype? The model
shows that this behavior can yield an evolutionary advantage by redirecting
resources into growth and away from polymers that help the bacterium to
compete with other strains, but this advantage occurs in a limited
time-window. Down-regulation of polymer secretion at high cell density can
evolve to afford bacteria a greater capacity for dispersal, but this is
disfavored in stable, long-lived biofilms. Our model suggests that the
observed differences in quorum sensing behavior can be explained by the
differing requirements of bacteria in chronic versus acute biofilm
infections. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000099">A Mechanistic Model for the Biomass
Spectrum in Aquatic Ecosystems<br>
</font>
<p><font color="#000099">The effect of variations in bottom-up and top-down
forcing upon the biomass spectrum (i.e., the distribution of biomass when
organisms are grouped by size) is analyzed using a size-structured aquatic
ecosystem model. The biomass spectrum is closely linked to the flow of energy
from primary producers to fish. The parameters and mechanisms controlling
steady-state model results are first diagnosed. It is shown that model
solutions using parameters within empirical ranges can recreate the slopes
and mean biomass of observed biomass spectra from three ecosystems spanning a
broad range of productivity. The zooplankton gross growth efficiency is
critical for matching the steady-state slopes of the spectra. Variability in
export sources and zooplankton half-saturation constants both provide ways of
matching the mean biomass. After understanding the basic model dynamics,
simulations in a 1-D water column are carried out to understand the relative
impacts of decadal changes in hydrography, wind patterns, and fish
populations on the structure and function of the Eastern Scotian Shelf
ecosystem. Plans for analysis within 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations
will then be described. </font></p>

California grasslands <br>
</font>
<p><font color="#000099">Elizabeth Borer is faculty in the Dept. of Zoology
at Oregon State University and visiting the Dobson Lab. <br>
Most pathogens exist within complicated food webs of hosts and their
resources, competitors, and consumers. While direct pathogen-host
interactions are often well-described, infection rates also may be indirectly
determined by the host&rsquo;s consumers and competitors or supply of the
host&rsquo;s resources. For vector-borne pathogens, the abiotic and community
context may directly or indirectly alter host infection prevalence by
controlling either host or vector species composition and population
dynamics. I will discuss results from work on a model system, the
aphid-vectored barley yellow dwarf virus in California grasslands. I combine
a dynamic model with field and greenhouse experiments to examine the role of
host composition and host quality on host infection rates and vector
preference and performance. Several factors (i.e. disease, fertilization, and
grazing) drive the host composition toward a community dominated by plant
species that maximize aphid population growth, thereby increasing local
pathogen prevalence. Infection prevalence in this host community could not be
predicted in the absence of the broader biotic and abiotic community
interactions. These results suggest that predicting infection rates in
natural host populations may require a more holistic approach extending to
indirect interactions within a whole-community context. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000099">From consensus in swarms to flow in
porous media: A `memory-free' approach <br>
</font>
<p><font color="#000099">Collective decision making in swarms has been
explored within the context of self-propelled particle models of `boids'
comprising naive and informed individuals. Several measures of decision
making for the collective have been suggested, mainly within the context of
conflicting directions for the informed sub-population. Here we propose an
analogy with flow in porous media that leads to a macroscopic model for an
ensemble of swarm centroids with only one preferential direction. This model
is based on the 2D Advection-Diffusion Equation with Memory (ADEM). The
parameters of the ADEM can be estimated from a single simulation run,
conceived as a `computational experiment'. This allows quick numerical
solution for the position pdf in comparison to individual-based simulations.
The memory can be thought of as a population-level measure of consensus,
since it can be shown that it controls whether the swarm moves diffusively
(no-consensus), purely advectively (full consensus) and the intermediate
regimes between these two extremes. Although the mathematics used is by no
means new, the biological interpretations seem novel. </font></p>

</font>
<p><font color="#000099">The distribution of genetic diversity in a
population contains information about natural selection, demographic
structure, geography, recombination, and mutation rates in the population.
There are a wide array of population genetic techniques used to infer these
parameters from various aspects of sequence data. I'll briefly outline one
such method, the Poisson Random Field (PRF) which uses the polymorphism
frequency spectrum to infer selective pressures. I'll describe how this
suffers from systematic biases that cause it to tend to erroneously infer
positive selection, particularly for bacterial and viral populations. I'll
present several new methods to correct these problems. I'll also describe how
all existing inference techniques leave a wide gap in our understanding of
genetic variation in an asexual population under selection. Depending on time
and interest, I'll describe some very preliminary ideas I have for addressing
this question. </font></p>

Fynbos?<br>
</font>
<p><font color="#000099">Fynbos is a fire-prone shrubland that occurs on
infertile sandy soils within South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. With over
7,000 plant species in 46,000 km2, the Fynbos has a floristic diversity that
is greater than that of many tropical rainforests. Invasion by alien trees
(mostly Acacia, Hakea and Pinus species) is altering the typical treeless
character of Fynbos and threatens native biodiversity. The success of these
invading trees makes the question of why native Fynbos trees never evolved
particularly compelling. I will present my current set of hypotheses that
seek to address this question, and I will discuss possible theoretical
frameworks within which to test these hypotheses. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000099">Emergence and maintenance of nutrient
limitation over multiple time scales in terrestrial ecosystems <br>
</font>
<p><font color="#000099">Nutrient availability limits primary production in
ecosystems worldwide, yet the processes governing the dynamics of nutrient
limitation are not well understood. Here we examine processes controlling
steady state and transient nutrient dynamics at three separate time scales in
a simple model of a single nutrient cycling through plants and soil. When the
only losses are from the plant-available nutrient pool (e.g., nitrate or
ammonium), nutrient limitation at steady state is impossible under a wide
class of conditions. However, plant biomass will appear to saturate on a time
scale controlled by plant nutrient turnover (years in grasslands or decades
to centuries in forests), even though it grows slowly forever. In contrast,
primary production can be nutrient-limited at steady state when there are
losses from the plant-unavailable nutrient pool (e.g., dissolved organic
nitrogen). The long time scale of the model (nutrient buildup in soil organic
nutrients and the ent ire system) is controlled by the plant-unavailable loss
rate, which is typically multiple millennia in grasslands and forests. The
short time scale of the model, at which available nutrients in the soil
equilibrate in hours to days, is controlled by biotic uptake. These insights
into the different time scales of terrestrial ecosystems can help guide
empirical and experimental studies. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000099">Climate sensitivity of forest nitrogen
cycles revealed with long-term watershed records <br>
</font>
<p><font color="#000099">Nitrogen cycling in northern hemisphere temperate
forests has been dramatically altered by human activity, particularly over
the last century. Cutting practices and atmospheric pollution have driven
many forests far from long-term N equilibrium, evidenced by widespread and
sustained N accumulation but also increased losses of plant available N in
stream waters. Such conditions have made it difficult to separate and examine
predicted effects of climate variation on forest N cycles. Here we use
long-term (32 yr) climatalogical and hydrochemical records from small
watersheds and a general theory of nutrient limitation to examine the
internal vital rates of the N cycle and the relative influence of climate and
atmospheric deposition. We develop a simple biogeochemical model that
captures the basic aspects of the terrestrial N cycle and parameterize it
within a maximum likelihood framework using observed monthly N inputs and
losses. We make the assumption that internal cycling (mineralization and
plant uptake) is at or near steady state despite aggrading forest biomass and
atmospheric N inputs in great excess of losses. We find our quasi-equilibrium
model produces realistic estimates of cycling rates and reasonable
reproduction of observed losses without explicit representation of space,
hydrologic dynamics, soil compartments, or species effects. Our analysis
revealed that N mineralization and its temperature sensitivity, not N
deposition, control most of the observed variation in N losses. Intra-annual
variation in plant available N concentrations was driven largely by
temperature with little influence of moisture while inter-annual dynamics
were better captured with fluxes, a pattern explained by precipitation
forcing and rapid equilibration of plant available N pools. Our results
further suggest that N mineralization has increased over the last 30 years
due to increasing temperature, which, in combination with increasing
deposition, would accelerate N cycling and thereby increase N availability to
plants but also potentially losses to stream waters. We suggest that such a
simple theoretical approach to examining historical input-output records can
provide critical insight into the climate sensitivity of terrestrial nutrient
cycles. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000099">Clinically-immune hosts as a refuge for
drug-sensitive malaria parasites <br>
</font>
<p><font color="#000099">Mutations in Plasmodium falciparum conferring
resistance to first-line antimalarial drugs have spread throughout the world
from a few independent foci, all located in in areas of unstable malaria
transmission in Southeast Asia and South America. Quantitative population
genetics models have suggested a number of mechanisms for this phenomenon
including the existence of high levels of clinical immunity in sub-Saharan
African populations. However, epidemiological models have concluded that
immunity does not qualitatively impact the evolution of resistance. Here, we
reconsider the role of immunity in the dynamics of malaria transmission and
its role in the evolution of antimalarial drug resistance under the
assumption that immune individuals are infectious. We find immunity can
reduce the effective reproductive rate of the resistant parasite as
transmission intensity increases. At high transmission levels the effective
reproductive rate of the resistant parasite may fall below the reproductive
rate of the sensitive parasite, even though the resistant parasite has a
higher basic reproductive rate, R0. Thus, immunity creates a natural
ecological refuge. Our results suggest an epidemiological rationale for the
more likely emergence of resistance in low transmission settings. This
finding has implications for the design of drug policies and the formulation
of malaria control strategies, especially those that lower malaria
transmission intensity. </font></p>

Saint Chester and the Shroud of Pinocchio<br>
</font>
<p><font color="#000099">The 1985 rediscovery of The Shroud of Pinocchio is
one of the major historical events of the 20th Century. The implications of
The Shroud force a reinterpretation of almost every field of human
intellectual endeavor, from history itself to religion, the psychiatry of
dreams, and millimetric radar technology. Yet all of the purported
contemporary facts surrounding The Shroud trace back to the deservedly
obscure Saint Chester (fl. ca. 800 C.E.). So a prerequisite to understanding
The Shroud is to discover as much as possible about the Saint. In turn, many
of the facts about Saint Chester have been filtered through the unfettered
imagination of J. Chester Farnsworth. The physical documentation of these
facts rests on a series of relics discovered by Farnsworth in his
grandmother&rsquo;s attic. These include, int. al.: &hellip; The Shroud
itself, &hellip; the Pinocchian Coins that were placed over the
deceased&rsquo;s eyes as subway tokens to the afterworld, &hellip; and the
unrelated but equally important Collective Reliquary of Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs. I hope that the presentation and analysis of these facts and
artifacts will make it clear that The Shroud of Pinocchio can stand proudly
with all the other famous Shrouds. </font></p>
