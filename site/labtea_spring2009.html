        systems often occur without apparent warning, and may represent shifts 
        between alternative persistent states.&nbsp; Examples include lake

        ecosystem managers would like to detect such transitions before they 
        occur in order to avert or mitigate a shift to an undesirable

        some recent papers on this topic and present some ongoing and published

        size=2 face=Arial>Meeting the needs of humans and wildlife is a major 
        challenge for society. Wolong Nature Reserve, a 200,000-ha rural area 
        for giant panda conservation in China, is an excellent laboratory to 
        study such a challenge. The “flagship” reserve is home to approximately 
        10% of wild giant pandas and almost 5,000 local residents. Furthermore, 
        it is an open system that has been increasingly influenced by forces 
        such as urbanization and globalization. A long-term interdisciplinary 
        study indicates that interactions among panda habitat, people, and 
        government policies are very complex and dynamic. Many findings from the 
        reserve are also applicable to other coupled human and natural systems

        size=2 face=Arial>Lévy walks are a class of random walks with power-law 
        distributed move steps that can generate beneficial statistical 
        properties in uninformed search processes. Many scientists have started 
        to look at these properties in animal movement trajectories without 
        fully understanding the essential conditions and the mechanisms by which 
        Lévy walks may enhance random encounter success. As a result of this and 
        the difficulty of characterizing power-law distributions from empirical 
        data, there is controversy about both the empirical evidence and the 
        potential role of Lévy walk strategies in animal movement. Based on 
        simulations and random walk theory I will show when and why Lévy walks 
        are beneficial as search strategies, and I will discuss the generality 
        of the results found in comparison with other random walk strategies. In 
        order to progress in showing (or rejecting) any evidence of stochastic 
        searching in a biological and evolutionary context, it is first 
        essential that biologists and ecologists clearly understand what are the 
        basic assumptions, the mechanistic principles, and the degree of 
        generality of the Lévy walk hypothesis.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

        scientists have studied plant and animal biogeography (patterns of

        to what extent community composition is determined by historical events

        that both factors are important for determining macroorganism 
        distributions, it is still an open question for microorganisms.&nbsp; 
        Only more recently has data become available to allow us to ask similar 
        questions about microbial communities.&nbsp; The first microbial 
        biogeography studies have focused almost exclusively on spatial patterns

        face=Arial>Empirical work has highlighted the critical role of 
        nonstructural carbon storage in determining forest tree species’ growth 
        and survivorship. Here we evaluate the functional roles of carbon 
        storage with a simple mathematical model. We focus our analysis on how 
        carbon storage affect saplings’ (1) growth rate; (2) shade tolerance; 
        and (3) survivorship under temporally heterogeneous light environment 
        before they reach canopy. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Model analysis shows 
        that sapling diameter growth rate is negatively affected by carbon 
        storage when the size of a tree is small; but this negative effect 
        almost diminishes when a tree’s diameter is big enough. The tolerant 
        time for a tree under constant negative net carbon gain is carbon 
        storage (&#945;) dependent, and the maximum length of the period of A&lt;0 is 
        (1+&#945;) times for a storer than a non-storer. However, the time for a tree 
        or tree cohort to reach canopy is independent of carbon storage. 
        Mathematical analysis also shows that carbon storage also enhances the 
        survival fraction under negative net carbon gain. Together, our simple 
        mathematical work here strongly supports the fundamental contribution of 
        carbon storage in mechanistically determining the trade-off between 
        growth in light and survivorship in shade.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

        size=2 face=Arial>I will present work in progress on a framework for 
        understanding winner-loser effects in animal fighting using a fusion of 
        evolutionary game theory and hierarchical Bayesian estimation. When two 
        animals fight over a resource, the outcome is affected to by their prior 
        fighting experience, in addition to their relative ability and 
        motivation. Prior winning experiences increase an individual’s chance of 
        winning subsequent contests, and prior losing experiences decrease them, 
        all other things being equal. These “winner and loser effects” are so 
        widespread in nature as to seem almost a universal of social life, and 
        are important because they can account for the emergence and 
        stabilization of social structures such as dominance hierarchies. 
        Existing models of self-organizing social structure assume winner-loser 
        effects into existence and build from there. No evolutionary model 
        exists linking the parameters describing the social and resource 
        environment, through the equilibrium strategies employed by individuals, 
        to emergent social structure. With such a model, we could begin to ask 
        interesting questions relevant to many species (including our own) about 
        which conditions are most likely to lead to robust or fragile social 
        structures. I will outline a very simple, intuitive model of how and why 
        animals evolve strategies that integrate information gained during past 
        fights and use that information to guide their behavior in subsequent 
        ones.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

        size=2 face=Arial>A fundamental question in biology is to understand how 
        evolution can favor collective behaviors which benefit the group as a 
        whole (e.g., mass migrations) when the natural selection is acting at 
        the level of individuals who act in their own interest. This question is 
        particularly important when the individuals concerned are unrelated to 
        one another. I will present preliminary results from our group on the 
        evolution of collective behavior in the context of mass migration that 
        occurs in a variety of organisms. The results are based on simulating 
        massive number of individuals who interact in a large spatially explicit 
        and noisy environment using a personal supercomputing system. The work 
        is still in its initial stages and any feedback would be 
        great.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

        size=2 face=Arial>In both biotic and abiotic environments, bacteria 
        often live in surface-bound, densely populated groups. One of the most 
        widespread and visually conspicuous microbial behaviors associated with 
        group life is the secretion of a polymer matrix (EPS) consisting mostly 
        of polysaccharides, with traces of protein and DNA. The functions of 
        this matrix are not very well known, but it is often assumed to be a 
        public good that benefits all cells in the vicinity of an individual 
        secreting it. Some theory and circumstantial evidence, on the other 
        hand, suggests the opposite--namely, that EPS secretion is a competitive

        particle models (SPPs) are a class of agent-based simulations that have 
        been successfully used to explore questions related to various flavors 
        of collective motion, including&nbsp; flocking, swarming, and milling. 
        These models typically consist of particle configurations, where each 
        particle moves with constant speed, but changes its orientation in 
        response to&nbsp; local averages of the positions and orientations of 
        its neighbors found within some interaction region. &nbsp; These local 
        averages are based on&nbsp;'social interactions', which include 
        avoidance of collisions, attraction, and polarization, that are 
        designed&nbsp; to generate configurations&nbsp; that move as a single 
        object. Errors made by the individuals in the estimates of the state of 
        the local configuration are modeled as a random rotation of the updated 
        orientation resulting from the social rules. More recently, SPPs&nbsp; 
        have been introduced in the context of collective decision-making, where 
        the main innovation consists of dividing the population into naïve and 
        `informed' individuals. Whereas naïve individuals follow the classical 
        collective motion rules, members of the informed sub-population update 
        their orientations according to&nbsp; a weighted average of the social 
        rules and a fixed 'preferred' direction, shared by all the informed 
        individuals. Collective decision-making is then understood in terms of 
        the ability of the informed sub-population to steer the whole group 
        along the preferred direction. Summary statistics of collective 
        decision-making are defined in terms of the&nbsp; stochastic properties 
        of the random walk followed by the centroid of the configuration as the 
        particles move about, in particular the scaling behavior of the mean 
        squared displacement (msd).&nbsp; For the region of parameters where the 
        group remains coherent , we note that there are two characteristic time 
        scales,&nbsp; first&nbsp; there is&nbsp; an anomalous transient shared 
        by both purely naïve and informed&nbsp; configurations, i.e. the scaling 
        exponent lies between 1 and 2. The long-time behavior of the msd of the 
        centroid walk scales linearly with time for naïve groups (diffusion), 
        but shows a sharp transition to quadratic scaling (advection) for 
        informed ones. These observations suggest that the mesoscopic variables 
        of interest are the magnitude of the drift, the diffusion coefficient 
        and the time-scales at which the anomalous and the asymptotic behavior 
        respectively dominate transport, the latter being linked to the time 
        scale at which the group reaches a decision.&nbsp; In order to estimate 
        these summary statistics from the msd,&nbsp;we assumed that the 
        configuration centroid follows an uncoupled Continuous Time Random Walk 
        (CTRW) with smooth jump and waiting time pdf's.&nbsp; The&nbsp; 
        mesoscopic transport equation for this type of random walk corresponds 
        to an Advection-Diffusion Equation with Memory (ADEM). &nbsp; The 
        introduction of the memory, and thus non-Markovian effects, is necessary 
        in order to correctly account for the two characteristic &nbsp;time 
        scales present.&nbsp; Although we were not able to calculate the memory 
        directly from the individual-level rules, we show that it can be 
        estimated&nbsp; from a single, relatively short, simulation run using a 
        Gamma density and &nbsp;a Mittag-Leffler function as templates.&nbsp; 
        With these functions it is possible to predict accurately the behavior 
        of the msd, as well as the full pdf for the position of the centroid. 
        The resulting ADEM is self-consistent in the sense that transport 
        parameters estimated from the memory via a Kubo relationship coincide 
        with those estimated from the moments of the jump size pdf of the 
        associated CTRW for a large number of group sizes, proportions of 
        informed individuals, and degrees of bias along the preferred 
        direction.&nbsp; We also discuss the phase diagrams for the transport 
        coefficients estimated from this method.&nbsp;We also note that the time 
        scale to collective decision is invariant&nbsp; with respect to group 
        size, and depends only on the proportion of informed individuals and the 
        strength of the coupling along the informed 
      direction.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

        specifically: Which is the distribution from where the organism should

        understanding running and walking we look to a wonderful and beautiful 
        species: the cockroach! &nbsp;The insect may not have the aesthetics of 
        a cheetah or Olympic sprinter, but cockroaches are incredibly adept and 
        efficient runners that have the skill to elude boots or insect friendly 
        traps. &nbsp;In my lab tea, I would like to briefly describe how we, 
        very generally, view cockroach locomotion. This broad summary will 
        attempt to describe how very diverse systems, such as groups of neurons 
        and the exoskeleton, can interact to generate movement. &nbsp;In the 
        context of this global story, I will focus in greater detail on the 
        effect of reflexes in running. Reflexes attempt to feed back information 
        from one system, the body-limb mechanics, to the neuronal system in 
        order to modulate the commands sent back to the muscles and limbs. 
        &nbsp;Lastly, I will present the progress we have made in understanding 
        how simple mathematical models of neurons are affected by feedback and 
        conclude with results from a more sophisticated neuro-mechanical model 
        where feedback increases the stability during

        size=2 face=Arial>Sustainable management of the commons is contingent 
        upon cooperation among its users restraining themselves from individual 
        short-sighted resource overexploitation. Maintaining such cooperation 
        against the myopic self interest of individual users and despite growing 
        environmental pressure is a challenging task. However, numerous 
        experiments and field results have shown that shared social norms can 
        promote cooperation under certain conditions. We want to investigate the 
        role of other regarding preferences, such as a fairness norm, on the 
        establishment and maintenance of cooperation in a common pool resource 
        subject to social and ecological change. The study is informed by recent 
        institutional developments in water management in a semi-arid river 
        basin. We interface an evolutionary game theoretic model with an 
        agent-based approach to identify conditions under which concerns for 
        equity leading to ostracism towards norm violators can promote the 
        evolution of cooperation. Initial results show that coexistence between 
        co-operators and defectors arises when the income difference between 
        co-operators and defectors becomes large. On the other hand, cooperation 
        is more difficult to establish when interactions are such that defectors 
        can occasionally get away with free riding. We are still in the midst of 
        developing the models and welcome feedback on the conceptual approach 
        and potential simulation experiments. </FONT><BR>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
