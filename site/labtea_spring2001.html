 The  Trouble with Development is the Trouble with Us</font></font></font></b></p>
 </center>
   
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The "progress paradigm" that fuelled massive
  development efforts over the last five decades is faltering badly because
  of strong</font> <br>
 <font face="Arial,Helvetica">anti-development sentiments in both developed
  and developing nations. So far the detractors have emphasized the numerous
  negative social and</font> <br>
 <font face="Arial,Helvetica">environmental consequences accompanying  "economic 
progress", which has led development apologists to relabel their  efforts 
as "people-centered"</font> <br>
 <font face="Arial,Helvetica">and "sustainable".&nbsp; On top of these  problems 
with the achievement of progress, there is the possibility that  we have defined
progress wrongly, and are pursuing the wrong goal.</font> </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Most workers assume that we progress when
  we maximize wealth or experience.&nbsp; I claim that we ought to maximize
  *welfare* and question</font> <br>
 <font face="Arial,Helvetica">whether this entails maximizing either  wealth 
or experience.&nbsp; Several lines of evidence suggest that welfare  is compromised 
by excess wealth</font> <br>
 <font face="Arial,Helvetica">or experience, and a plausible theory  of interests 
and welfare predicts this empirical result.&nbsp; Unlike with  wealth or experience,
we have no</font> <br>
 <font face="Arial,Helvetica">accepted method for maximizing welfare.&nbsp;
I will present one simple method, and discuss an example and why it may 
not be optimal.&nbsp; I will conclude with a second possibility, and a  message 
of hope.</font> </p>

 Best  foraging strategy to optimize growth of a bumble bee colony: maximize 
profit  rate or efficiency?</font></font></font></b></p>
 </center>
   
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will present a demographic model of a 
bumble bee colony for evaluating the colony fitness consequences of a range
 of worker bee nectar foraging strategies.&nbsp; These vary along a trade-off
  axis from more efficient strategies (high energy benefit/cost) to more
 "speedy" ones (high net rate of energy gain).&nbsp; The greater the rate
 of nectar supply, the more quickly larvae and pupae mature into new workers.&nbsp;
However, the harder workers work, the more rapidly they senesce and die.&nbsp;
Colony fitness is estimated as the sterile worker bee population size at
 the end of the colony growth period, when the colony switches to making
 reproductives.&nbsp; I expect that the tension between raising juvenile
 development rate and lowering worker mortality, both mediated by foraging
 strategy, will lead to different favored foraging strategies for growth
 periods of different lengths.</font> </p>

 Testing  for Self-Similarity in a Northern Californian Serpentine Grassland</font></font></font></b></p>
 </center>
   
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In earlier work, we showed that the power-law
  species-area relationship (SAR) and range-area relationship (RAR) imply
  self-similarity in the spatial distribution of species at the community
 and individual species level, respectively. We also showed that predictions
 for a host of other fundamental ecological characteristics can be derived
 from the self-similarity property. Derived community-level characteristics
 include an endemics-area relationship, an abundance distribution and a 
commonality formula that describes the fraction of species in common to 
two patches as a function of patch size and inter-patch distance. Derived
 species-level characteristics include a power-law relationship between 
the abundance of a species and its geographic range size, an abundance  distribution
and a relative neighborhood density function that characterizes  the spatial
aggregation of individuals. To test theory we censused plants  on serpentine
substrate, recording the total abundance of every plant species  within one
64 m2 plot gridded into 256 0.25 m2 squares. There were a total  of 24 species
and 37,182 individuals. The species-area relationship is  well fit by a power-law,
indicating self-similarity at community level.  The observed individual species
abundance distributions and total abundance  of each species are consistent
with theory, as are the predicted slopes  of plots of log(range size) versus
log(abundance). On the other hand, the  endemics-area relationship, the community-level
abundance distribution,  and the commonality formula did not agree with the
data. Possible causes  of these divergences from theory are discussed.</font>

 HIV  quasispecies dynamics and treatment</font></font></font></b></p>
 </center>
   
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The distribution of variant strains of  HIV 
in the body is probably very important to understanding the long-term  behavior 
of the disease and its response to drugs that target particular  strains. 
I will describe a model of the virus-immune system interaction  that explicitly 
describes the distribution of variants (that is, a quasispecies  model) and 
look at the</font> <br>
 <font face="Arial,Helvetica">effect of model assumptions on the ability
 of the disease to evade treatment.&nbsp; In particular, immunologists have
 observed that the wild type virus can be significantly depressed by current
 treatments, but that an escape can occur in which several mutations accumulate,
 each of which is significantly detrimental, but which produce a fit and
 drug-resistant strain when combined (that is, the population crosses a 
valley several mutations wide in the fitness landscape).&nbsp; I hope to
 describe the analogous behavior in the quasispecies model.&nbsp; This work
 is done with Alan Perelson and others at Los Alamos lab and the Santa Fe
 Institute.</font> </p>

 A  (kind of) mechanistic model of stomatal control</font></font></font></b></p>
 </center>
   
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Semi-empirical models of stomatal conductance
  (gs) are usually used to relate gs with assimilation rate, vapor pressure
  deficit, atmospheric CO2 partial pressure, and soil moisture. I propose
  a model for the response of stomata to these factors that is based on the
  mechanisms of: (1)diffusion across stomata, (3)photosynthesis, and (3)plant
  water transport. The advantage of the model over previous ones is that
 all the parameters have an explicit physical meaning, potentially allowing
 independent estimation and model validation using gas exchange measurements.
 The main assumption is that stomatal conductance has two regimes of behavior,
 depending on the water supply-demand relation. In one regime, supply is
 abudant and gs is controlled only by photosynthesis. When supply cannot
 meet demand, stomatal conductance adjusts so that demand is equal to the
 maximum possible supply given soil moisture. I will descibe the model, 
show some simulations, and throw out some ideas about plant strategies  defined
in terms of the model parameters.</font> </p>

 Elephants,  fire, and woodland structure</font></font></font></b></p>
 </center>
   
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Trees in many Southern African savanna  ecosystems 
endure high levels of disturbance &#8211; fire, frost, elephants &#8211;  and stress e.g.,
drought.&nbsp; Several attempts have been made to model  the dynamics of
these savannas under various disturbance regimes, but so  far in all of the
models I have encountered the response of trees to disturbance  depends solely
on tree size, and not on any other state variables.&nbsp; I believe (and
may be able to show&#8230;) that this type of approach may be  inadequate to explain
the apparent stability of what could be called the  coppice phase (made up
of stunted shrubs with a rather weird architecture)  in these woodland savannas.</font>
 </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would like to argue that the response 
(survivorship and subsequent growth) of plants to damage varies with the
 frequency, extent, and timing (in terms of phenology) of disturbance i.e.,
 the history of disturbance is important.&nbsp; My research proposes to 
test the hypothesis that the carbon balance of trees needs to be taken  into
account when assessing the impact of a given disturbance regime.&nbsp; I
am in the process of developing a (still crude) mechanistic model of  woodland
savanna structure as a function of elephant and fire disturbance,  and with
any luck, will be able to show some preliminary results from this  model
on Tuesday.</font> </p>

 Theoretical  explorations of the effects of localized specialist pests on 
plant communities</font></font></font></b></p>
 </center>
   
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At least since Gillett's 1962 paper, many
  ecologists have recognized the potential for species-specific pests to
 contribute to the maintenance of species diversity.&nbsp; Numerous empirical
 studies, especially in tropical forests, have demonstrated that many pests
 act in a locally density-dependent way.&nbsp; Yet relatively little theoretical
  work has explored the implications of local density-dependence, leaving
 many scientists holding incorrect ideas (e.g., the notion that if such 
effects are operating, recruitment must peak some distance away from adults
 and adult trees must be regularly spaced) and debating fruitless points
 (e.g., does the effect work by keeping common species from becoming more
 common or by keeping rare species from going extinct).</font> </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Through simple simulations and analytical
  work, Fred Adler and I investigate the consequences of localized specialist
  natural enemies for plant populations and communities.&nbsp; Specifically,
  we ask how the dispersal distances of seeds and pests affect rates and
 patterns of increase of new species, adult spatial patterns, and the maintenance
 of species diversity.&nbsp; I will present our models and preliminary results.</font>

 The  stability of genomes in populations: applications to cancer biology</font></font></font></b></p>
 </center>
   
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will dare to discuss some unfinished  research 
I've been conducting along with David Krakauer -- and with Jonathan  Dushoff's 
continual support -- into the stability of genomic sequences  in a population 
at mutation-selection equilibrium.&nbsp; In particular,  I will mention several 
biological mechanisms of mutational buffering and  mutational sensitivity, 
and demonstrate that the former is expected in  small-populations, and the 
latter in large populations. Complex multicellular  organisms tend to live 
in relatively small populations, though the cells  of which they are comprised 
experience huge populations sizes.&nbsp; For  such organisms, the interplay 
of mutational sensitivity and buffering operates  on two levels of selection: 
sensitivity at the cellular level promotes  stability at the tissue and organism 
level.&nbsp; I will model this situation  -- the stabilizing effect of apoptosis 
-- in some detail, providing analytic  results on the waiting time until tumorgensis,
given the apoptotic profile  of a cell.</font> </p>

 Individual-based  modeling for high prevalence of multiple Wolbachia infections 
in the azuki  bean beetle</font></font></font></b></p>
 </center>
   
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Wolbachia is an endosymbiont bacteria and
  is widely seen in many arthropods. Wolbachia can operate its host's reproduction
  (male-killing, feminization, cytoplasmic incompatibility, etc.) and spread
  in the host population, so it is called a selfish genetic element.&nbsp;
However, double coinfections with different Wolbachia strains have been 
reported only in several&nbsp; nsects, and triple infections are far rarer.&nbsp;
Considering advantages of multiple infections, it is rather paradoxical 
why multiple coinfections with Wolbachia are so rare in nature?</font> <br>
 <font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To understand  factors 
involved in maintenance of multiple infections in a host population,  experimental 
studies using a model organism with multiple Wolbachia infections  are necessary.&nbsp; 
Our group has recently found nearly perfect infections  with Wolbachia in 
the azuki been beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis (Kondo  et al. 1999), and 
it was very high prevalence (&gt;90%) of the triple coinfection  (Ori, Con, 
and Aus strains).&nbsp; The triple infection in C. chinensis  will be an ideal
research subject for this purpose because the insect has  been widely used
in population dynamics experiments for a long time.</font> <br>
 <font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An individual-based
  model was constructed for examining population dynamics of multiple Wolbachia
  infections in C. chinensis.&nbsp; An individual C. chinensis female mates
  the male, and CI occurred if the female did not have a Wolbachia strain
  the male partner had.&nbsp; Parametric values were determined from our
 experiment.&nbsp; In a randomly mating population, the triple infection
 class can spread in almost all the population if the fitness cost with 
infections is lower than a threshold value.&nbsp; However, the triple infection
 class can hardly invade into a large, randomly mating population where 
the double infection class has already prevailed.&nbsp; As a factor to  promote
the invasion of the triple infection class, the second model included  a
meta-population structure and extinction-recolonization processes in  local
subpopulations, which agree with actual life histories of C. chinensis.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The second model predicted that the local extinction-recolonization processes
 could promote prevalence of the triple infection status with a founder 
effect.</font>  </p>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstract</font> </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By adopting a functional group approach 
we characterize regional patterns of community structure as the abundance
 of space occupiers-- macroalgae and bentihc filter-feeders -- in asociation
  with an index of ecosystem functioning-- fotosintetic pigment concentration
  i.e. Productivity. Functional identity follows differences in energy acquisition-utilization
  pathways, which we define as life- history trade-offs in competitive ability
  (Tilman 1994).&nbsp; Using a smooth (sensu, Adler 2000) competitive hierarchy
  we link the index of ecosystem performance -, to demographic process---clearence
  and recruitment---, assuming the existance of whole group-average competitive
  and dispersal behaviour.&nbsp; Our model is intended to build a mechanistic
  explanation for patterns of strong biophysical coupling between benthic
  and pelagic ecosystems.&nbsp; As such, it explicitly forces the dynamics
  of benthic community structure to the performance of the pelagic community
  integrated into the index. We studied the regional variation in functional
  structure of rocky intertidal communities across regional gradients of
 primary productivity in the coast of central Chile, and compared them to
 model predicitons of total space occupancy and space partitioning among
 funtional groups.&nbsp; Our main theoretical result predicts the existance
 of productivity thresholds at which the long term functional composition
 of the community will exchange stability among diffent functional structure
 states.&nbsp; Community structure surveys show the existance of a sharp
 transition in functional structure coherent with an abrupt change in productivity.&nbsp;
Our results provide a mechanistic basis to the strong dependancy with oceanographical
 regim that has been experimentally identified in temperate rocky shores.&nbsp;
In agreement with our results, different functional groups will partition
 resources according to a generalized set of life-history trade-offs. Patterns

 Enabling  microscopic simulators to perform system-level analysis</font></font></font></b></p>
 </center>
   
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will discuss&nbsp; a "mathematics-assisted"
  computational methodology that enhances the scope of existing, state-of-the-art
  microscopic dynamic simulators, such as Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo,
  or kinetic theory-based methods like Lattice-Boltzmann.&nbsp; Specifically,
  I will describe a time-stepper-based computational superstructure that
 can be "wrapped around" existing and future such simulation codes.&nbsp;
This methodology will enable advanced, system-level analysis and design 
methods for complex, nonlinear, distributed processes including materials
 fabrication, as well as a broad class of transport and chemical reaction
 phenomena.&nbsp; This framework (for the appropriate type of problem!) 
exploits the best available dynamic microscopic simulators beyond the direct
 simulation tasks they currently perform, enabling them to perform system-level
 stability, operability, bifurcation, parameter sensitivity, design and 
control tasks.&nbsp; Currently, this type of computation is simply inaccessible
 to microscopic simulators.</font> </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;This effort aims at bridging systematically
  and effectively the enormous gap between the microscopic description of
  a complex material/transport system and system-level analysis of direct
 engineering importance.&nbsp; Specifically, this "mathematics-assisted"
 approach will enable microscopic-level codes to perform system-level tasks
 directly, without the need to pass through an intermediate or macroscopic-level
 (conventional) description of the dynamical system through macroscopic 
(usually partial differential or integro-differential) evolution equations.</font>
 </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;This procedure can have general applicability
  to all systems for which a macroscopic description is conceptually possible
  but unavailable in closed form; if accurate macroscopic models are available
  in closed form they should be employed directly.&nbsp; What we propose
 here is a systematic way to extract from microscopic simulations precisely
 the computational information one would obtain from macroscopic models,
 had these models been available in closed form.&nbsp; It is the difficulty
 in obtaining and closing such models that the proposed approach will circumvent.&nbsp;
This will be effected through "technology transfer" from state-of-the-art,
  time-stepper-based numerical computation of asymptotic dynamics of evolution
  equations to asymptotic coarse dynamics of microscopic simulators.&nbsp;
In a sense, our approach consists of "unavailable model-motivated" processing
  of microscopic dynamical information.</font> </p>

 The  voter model and company</font></font></font></b></p>
 </center>
   
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I won't have time to detail the background
  on the voter model, so here is a brief update:</font> </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The voter model is by far the best-known
  spatially explicit model. Place one elector per node on a d-dimensional
 lattice, and assume that, at each time step, this elector takes the opinion
 of one of his or her neighbors, chosen at random. In its original version,
 two political opinions were allowed, but the generalization to more opinions
  is quite straightforward. Notice that this model is different from the
 "majority vote" model (when the elector polls his or her neighbors, and
 chooses the most common opinion), and from the well-known "cow skin" model
 of Henry Horn.</font> </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The voter model is so simple because it 
can be mapped onto a system of coalescing random walks (RW), i.e. RWs that
 merge upon encounter. Replace the 'political opinions' by 'species' and
 notice that an individual at site x, at time t, has a unique parent at 
time t-1, which either was in the immediate neighborhood or at the same 
position. This ancestor also has a unique parent, and so forth. The path
 of the ancestors can be seen as a RW, moving backwards in time. Thanks 
to this duality, probabilists have been able to prove a number of beautiful
 theorems. A fundamental result, for example, is that one species always
 take over the system in one and two dimensions (exclusive competition),
 while a mixture of species coexist in three and more dimensions (Holley
 and Liggett 1975). It would be tempting to apply this type of model in 
population genetics and in ecology, and in fact, the stepping stone model
 of Kimura, as well as Hubbell's neutral model can easily be rephrased in
 the jargon of the voter model. One only needs to add mutations in the model:
 a site that has just mutated does not have a 'parent'; a mutation is therefore
 equivalent to 'killing' a RW of the dual model.</font> </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff">&nbsp;<b>Summary  of 
talk</b>:</font></font> </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1- Voter model without mutation</font> <br>
 <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Recently, we have realized that several  two-dimensional 
models, which do not possess an obvious dual mapping (and  therefore seem 
difficult to study analytically) share many common features  with the voter 
model, for example the number of interfaces decrease as  one over the logarithm 
of time. Moreover, we have studied a persistence  measure that also appears 
to be "universal". I will introduce it precisely  during the talk. General 
conditions for a model to belong to the "voter  universality class" will be
stated.</font> </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2- Voter model with mutation</font> <br>
 <font face="Arial,Helvetica">In this case there is no coarsening, but  a 
critical transition is observed, as the mutation rate tends to zero.  In other
words, the voter model with no mutation is critical in the sense  of phase
transitions. This transition has very simple critical exponents:  the correlation
length scales as the mutation rate, raised to the power  -1/2. Incidentally,
this contradicts a claim that this transition has non-trivial   critical
exponents (de Oliveira, J. Phys. A, 1993).</font> </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">3- Comparison with other models of diversity</font>
  <br>
 <font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have compared the voter model to a  model 
with a competition-mortality tradeoff between the species. I will  present 
recent simulations of the simplest version of this model (with  no space limitation),
which seem to confirm a conjecture by Buttel, Durrett  and Levin.</font> 
<br>
 <font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have also performed preliminary simulations
  on a generalization of the voter model where species are labeled from 1
  to S, and species i can only interact with species i-1 or i+1 (modulo S-1).
  For S=2, this is exactly the voter model. Cox and Griffeath (1989) prove
  that a similar one-dimensional model coarsens if S &lt;= 4, and fixates
  (as in Horn's cow skin model) if S &gt;4. My runs suggest that in two dimensions,
  the model belongs to the voter universality class for S&lt;8, but not for
  S&gt;=8.</font> </p>
