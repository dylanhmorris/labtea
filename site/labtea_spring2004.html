</font></p>
<p>We analyze tree growth data from Wisconsin forest inventories
completed in 1968, 1983, 1996 and 2002.&nbsp; These show that the rate
of forest growth decreased steadily over the period, in contrast to the
increases predicted by CO2 fertilization models.&nbsp; Measured growth
rate changed an average of -0.27% y-1 (95% confidence range: -0.05% to
-0.49% y-1), whereas the prediction for CO2 fertilization is 0.16% y-1
(corresponding to a &#946; of 0.36).&nbsp; The high statistical precision is
due both to
large sample sizes and positive correlations among the growth rates
from different time periods within the same plot.&nbsp; Decreased
growth
occurred in stands of all ages, and so our results are not caused by
age-related declines in growth (although highly significant age-related
declines were also detected).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data allowing a direct examination of growth rates
over several decades are available only for Wisconsin, but Caspersen et
al. (2000) introduced an indirect method for detecting past changes in
growth rate using only two sequential inventories.&nbsp; This method
was criticized by Joos et al. (2002), who claimed that it lacked the
statistical power to falsify state-of&#8211;the-art ecosystem models of CO2
fertilization.&nbsp; We explain both the sound points and the critical
errors in Joos et al.&#8217;s argument, introduce a transparent and
analytically tractable version of Caspersen et al.&#8217;s method, and check
its ability to detect the decreasing growth rates in the Wisconsin
data.&nbsp; The results show that the indirect method accurately
characterizes the past changes that actually occurred, and has
sufficient statistical power to falsify CO2 fertilization models,
including the model in Joos et al. (2002).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We discuss the implications of decreasing Wisconsin
growth rates, together with other reasons for skepticism
about the future magnitude of CO2 fertilization.&nbsp; In particular,
the steep reductions in fossil fuel emissions required to stabilize
atmospheric CO2 at 500+50 ppm must begin more than a decade sooner
if the predictions of the CO2 fertilization models in the IPCC Third
Assessment (Prentice et al.&nbsp; 2001) are incorrect.&nbsp; The
difference
between a terrestrial carbon sink that grows because of CO2
fertilization,
and one that shrinks because it is caused by recovery from past land
use, is the difference between the luxury of a substantial delay and
the
need to act now.</p>

inter-specific aggressivity in the process of biological invasion</font></p>
<p>Biological invasions are the second cause of biodiversity loss after
habitat destruction. It makes invasion biology one of the priority
fields of
integrative research for population biologists. However, the
evolutionary
consequences of invasions have been poorly investigated. Our project
aims at investigating some behavioral-based selective mechanisms that
are likely to be involved in the invasion process. How do they shape
the evolutionary potential, life history and behavioral traits of
invasive
species? We identified two behavioral aspects that have been
disregarded
: (1) Is gregariousness selected for during the establishment phase of
an alien species ? (2) Is inter-specific aggressiveness selected for in
response to competition during invasion?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two lines of research will be addressed
through (i) comparative analyses of invasion success at the
inter-specific level, and (ii) by implementing experimental
introductions at invasion front with different group size as
experimental treatments. The model
species is the House Sparrow Passer domesticus. Because of the lower
&#8220;dilution&#8221; of propagules during the introduction event (Allee effect),
we expect
(i) gregarious species, and (ii) high group size (10 indivdiuals), to
be
more successful in getting established than non-gregarious species and
low group size (2 individuals). Introduced individuals will be
radio-tracked
continuously during the first three days after release (and then once
per
weak for three weaks) to document how group size affects their
dispersal
behavior and their interactions with the native &#8220;ecological sparrow&#8221;
(Zonotrichia
capensis). </p>

Distribution of three oak species in south-central Spain: environment,
management, metapopulation dynamics and habitat fragmentation<br>
<br>
Many plant populations consist of local populations confined to patches
of suitable habitat, which may or may not be linked by dispersal, in a
landscape that is environmentally heterogeneous and subject to
historical and recent changes in climate and management. The response
of these populations to
future perturbations will depend on the interaction between these
features, but theoretical and empirical studies tend to treat them
separately, and
to make unrealistic assumptions about the other processes. I&#8217;ve been
making
an attempt to study how these processes interact in determining the
distribution of three different Oaks in Madrid and Castile La-Mancha,
Spain, for which there is data from 12000 forest inventory plots. I
begin with a traditional gradient analysis, relating the distributions
to physical and climatic factors, with or without information on
land-use and management. The gradient analysis is then extended into a
metapopulation-like framework of a network of populations connected by
local dispersal via acorn movements by Jays. I examine the
predictions of the metapopulation model under different combinations of
global or local dispersal, homogeneous or heterogeneous environment,
and
with or without variation in the seed output of established
populations,
and see how the gradient and metapopulation models differ in their
predictions
of how abundance responds to changes in habitat cover. I hope studies
like
this can help us to understand plant populations, but there&#8217;s only so
far
you can go with a pattern analysis. <br>

Robustness and adaptive capacity in social and ecological systems<br>
<br>
What makes social-ecological systems robust? Unlike in ecology, the
study of the impact on disturbance and stress on social systems is not
well developed. In this talk, a framework that helps to identify
potential vulnerabilities of social-ecological systems is proposed.
This framework acknowledge the different positions of actors involved
in resource governance, providing
opportunities for corruption, rent-seeking, ignorance and conflict. The
framework
helps us to identify how long-lasting institutions that are adapted to
certain
stress and disturbance regimes, and why others have failed and
collapsed.
Formal models to analyze the robustness of social-ecological systems
are
in development. Differences between ecosystems and social-ecological
systems
are addressed to identify potential similarities and differences that
may
help us to develop formal models of robustness and adaptive capacity in
social-ecological
systems.<br>

The evolution of cut-and-paste transposons in eukaryotes, esp. ciliates.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No complex and functional biological entity can
exist without natural selection acting to create and maintain it. So
what is the selective force that maintains functional transposable
elements in eukaryotes, against accumulating mutations? Sometimes there
isn't one: the observation has been that eukaryote cut-and-paste
transposons (not retroelements) very quickly accumulate inactivating
mutations, and go extinct in a host lineage; it has been thought that
only horizontal transmission to new hosts maintains active elements.
But there are exceptions, and data from genome projects is still being
shoehorned into old paradigms; the population genetic theory has not
been well developed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We found that the mariner-type transposons in
ciliated protozoa are a glaring exception to this generalization: these
transposons have evolved in their host's genomes under a strong
purifying selection. A collaborator, David Witherspoon, realized that
this selection can be explained by a trait-group selection: each host
genome is for a generation a trait-group of good and bad transposons.
David's application of Wilson's (1975) theory of group-or
multi-level-selection allows the many aspects of transposon biology to
be quantitatively considered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While trait-group selection is probably a minor
effect for most transposons, aspects of the ciliate life cycle may have
allowed trait-group selection to run amuck-may allow very high
transposition rates to be tolerated. So while some level of trait-group
selection must operate in all eukaryotes, it is particularly apparent,
and measurable, in ciliates. I hope to measure the transposition and
loss rates of the ciliate elements (2000/haploid genome), using
variations on methods that have been developed to quantitate large,
complex mRNA pools ("SAGE").<br>

<div align="left">Sapling growth and light availability in tropical
forests: analyzing general patterns and sources of variation<br>
<br>
Plant species vary in the dependence of juvenile growth and survival on
light availability, and this variation is an important axis of niche <br>
differentiation in virtually all plant communities.&nbsp; The overall
objective of this study is to characterize the distribution of tropical
forest trees <br>
in a light-dependence trait space -- both to quantify the contribution
of such niche differentiation to coexistence and to use the information
on the <br>
distribution of traits in ecosystem models.&nbsp; I use three years of
detailed growth and light availability measurements on 1500 saplings of
23 species <br>
on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, to investigate the dependence of
diameter growth on light.&nbsp; Light availability alone explains over
51% of the
<br>
variation in growth among all saplings, and 16-78% of the variation in
individual species, with individual species response parameters
strongly
<br>
related to wood density.&nbsp; As is usually the case in such studies,
there is extensive scatter around the fitted relationship for each
individual
<br>
species, and overlapping scatter among species.&nbsp; Traditional
analyses implicitly assume this scatter is measurement error, while a
recent paper <br>
by Jim Clark suggests it should be attributed almost entirely to
intraspecific differences in light response parameters among individual
<br>
trees.&nbsp; Here, I use explicit measurements of measurement error in
both light and growth to quantitatively assess the contribution of
these
errors <br>
to scatter in growth-light relationships, and to better constrain the
potential variation among individuals within species.&nbsp; I close
with <br>
discussion of different sources of variability in observed
relationships, and their implications for species niche differentiation.<br>

<div align="left">Relating ecological parameters to biogeographic
patterns in species diversity<br>
<br>
After well over 100 years of careful study, there is still little
consensus regarding broad scale patterns in species diversity.&nbsp;
Why are there are
so many species in the tropics?&nbsp; Or, why are there so few species
at
high latitudes.&nbsp; I will briefly review the three major competing
hypotheses:&nbsp;
(1) area, (2) current climate/productivity, and (3) history
(time/stability).&nbsp;
The neutral theory is, in my opinion, neutral on this issue; i.e.,
without
invoking one of the other 3 hypotheses, neutral theory tells us nothing
about
geographic patterns in diversity.&nbsp; I will argue that Area, is a
poor
primary candidate.&nbsp; Current climate/productivity is a good
candidate,
but its popular proposed mechanism (that more productivity allows
higher
total abundance and therefore diversity) makes no sense for
plants.&nbsp;
As for history, Pleistocene extinctions have undoubtedly affected
contemporary
diversity patterns (e.g., European trees), but many groups and regions
(e.g.,
marine invertebrates; N. American and E. Asian trees) appear to have
suffered
few extinctions in the last several million years.&nbsp; Climate
history
on longer time scales (10-100 Myrs) is probably more important in
explaining
contemporary diversity patterns; i.e., cold climates at high latitudes
arose
only in the last 20 Myrs.<br>
<br>
So, we have 2 tenable hypotheses:&nbsp; climate history over 10-100
Myrs, and contemporary climate/productivity.&nbsp; Developing a
mechanistic basis for the latter hypothesis requires that we study the
ecological attributes of communities across climatic and environmental
gradients.&nbsp; I will present
some analyses that are part of a nascent effort to do that for N.
American
trees.<br>

Horizontal gene transfer in American crows via shared tofu resources<br>
<br>
If intrinsic constraints on evolution are absent, what can cause the
formation
of species range boundaries within an environmental gradient?&nbsp; I
will
describe a demographic and quantitative genetic model in which gene
flow
from a range center can swamp local adaptation at more peripheral
locations,
leading to the formation of a stable range together with limits on the
extremes
to which a species evolves.&nbsp; This result holds assuming random,
diffusive
dispersal.&nbsp; However, some organisms&#8217; ability to disperse may
change
with the environment, such as may be the case for many stream or river
fauna,
because the force of water is generally stronger upstream.&nbsp; In the
second
part of my talk, I will use the same modeling framework to explore the
possible
consequences for distribution of organisms within streams, including
cases
where stream organisms have the potential to evolve their dispersal
abilities
in response to the changing dispersal environment.&nbsp; Finally, I
will
synthesize all of these results with a view toward suggesting the
important
consequences for the American crow and its preferred tofu resource.<br>

Who let the dogs out?<br>
<br>
Over 95% of all human rabies cases worldwide are the result of bites by
domestic
dogs. Yet our understanding of the dynamics of rabies is based almost
entirely
upon wildlife studies from Europe and North America, where dog rabies
is
rarely a threat to human life. I will discuss the pattern of epidemic
spread
in an ongoing rabies outbreak in Tanzania, starting from movement and
contact
patterns at the level of the infected individual, and scaling to the
population,
making some speculative predictions about rates of spread, and
incidence
under different management scenarios. I plan to use a combination of
modeling
and statistical analyses to address questions on rabies persistence and
potential
control methods in multi-host communities....and present a small amount
of
work (in progress, hoping for feedback) on this topic.<br>

</big></b>What determines nutrient ratios in phytoplankton biomass?<br>
<br>
As any other organism, algae contain essential chemical elements
(nutrients) in their biomass. The ratio of most nutrients (e. g.,
carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus.) vary across species, but the overall
ratio for most algal communities converge toward the same numbers (the
"Redfield ratio"). Both Redfield ratio and inter-specific variations
have important implications in community assembly and large scale
nutrient cycles, but their determinism remains widely unknown. I will
present a model of the metabolism and stocks of carbon, nitrogen,
phosphorus and energy within the algal cell, to address how
eco-physiological strategies lead to specific biomass ratios.<br>

On the spread of culture and other diseases<br>
<br>
Individual attitudes and actions regarding environmental issues, such
as consumptive behavior, are strongly influenced by social context and
norms.&nbsp; How do such norms emerge and spread, and when do sudden
shifts occur?&nbsp; Can we hope to change environmental attitudes by
influencing individual behaviors?&nbsp; Preliminary steps towards a
theoretical approach will be presented.&nbsp;&nbsp; Highly speculative
stuff.<br>

</big></b>What limits tree distribution ranges?</p>
<p>Mechanisms responsible for contemporary patterns of species
diversity remain unresolved. MacArthur (1972) believed that the ranges
of single species would seem to be the basic unit of biogeography.
Studies on species distribution ranges, particularly their
northern/upper and southern edges, may therefore provide insight into
the mechanisms of latitudinal and/or altitudinal biodiversity
gradients. Here I will discuss several inherently related stories (but
neither of them are complete) on tree species ranges and their range
limits. The altitudinal ranges of tree species in subtropical China
makes the expanded Rapoport?s Rule doubtful as an explanation for
altitudinal biodiversity gradients. Analysis on North Hemisphere forest
lines confirms the climatic constraints on forest limits. Finally I
will discuss the tradeoff between cold tolerance and diameter growth in
determining northern and southern edges for trees using FIA data.<br>
