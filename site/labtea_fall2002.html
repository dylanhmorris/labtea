<p>&nbsp;Biological interactions occur at specific locations involving the

 states, striking heterogeneous spatial patterns can emerge. Recognizing
the importance of space, biologists have struggled with the difficulties
of collecting data across spatial scales. </p>
 
<p>Recent advances in ocean monitoring technology are generating new insights
 on how fish move and interact. Mathematical modeling facilitates the exploration
 of the complexities in observed dynamics and aid in addressing hypotheses
 difficult to test in laboratory studies or open-ocean experiments. A spatially-explicit,
 individual-based model of bluefin tuna whereby interacting individuals coexist 
on a spatially heterogeneous ocean landscape will be presented. </p>
 
<p>With continued refinement and improvement, the model may lead to predictions
 of emergent patterns of bluefin spatial distribution, whereby spatial patterns
 are characterized on the basis of individual decision-making in schools,
seeking to maintain survival and improve evolutionary fitness. Selected results
from analyses of new experimental data and model simulations will be presented.
 </p>
 
<p>The talk will end by outlining several improvements required and two aspects

<p><font color="#000099">GENOMIC vs. GENETIC RATIONALES FOR SEX: Accounting
 for the mysterious origin of Darwin's 2.principle of variation</font> </p>
 
<p>Sexual biology consists of 2 distinct fields: Functions and adaptive uses 
of sexuality, and:&nbsp; the origin of sex in deep time. The former is an 
active field of study, while the latter has been ranked among the 4 major 
millenial scientific mysteries. Nonetheless, the advent of sex is generally 
taught according to the mechanism proposed by Weisman (1886) and Fisher (1930) 
as being due to the genetic advantages of sex. </p>
 
<p>Williams and Maynard Smith both showed around 1975 that such explanations
 were untenable: Sex at the cellular level is anti-reproductive and handicaps
 sexual relative to non-sexual species, &amp;: Adaptation by sex is ephemeral
 compared to adaptive mutations. How then could sex evolve from non-sexual
 species ? </p>
 
<p>My analysis suggests that sexual syngamy evolved from microbial syntrophy
 present among primordial biota around hot vents. The advent of anoxygenetic
 photosynthesis allowed invasion of seasonal photic biotopes ("polar paradise")
 which accounts for emergence of proto-eukarya which are incompatible with
 extreme thermal environs. However, survival in seasonal biotopes mandates
 heightened biochemical mutualism that blend dormancy and seasonal autotrophy.
 Sex may reflect the seasonal union of microbes in such metabolic interdependency,
 which evolved to syngamy and proto-meiosis under selective pressure of toxic 
photosynthetic di-oxygen. </p>
 
<p>My model&nbsp; suggests that "Life&#8217;s dual roots" mirror the separate descent 
of the two sexes, where eukarya originated by the sexual union of these microbial 
genomes, becoming novel species when meiosis evolved into (non-nucleated) 
mitosis. Non-sexual species arose later by shedding sex due to its high costs. 
Sex as a non-mutational adaptation to toxic oxygen is now an exaptation, but
the sexual life cycle may reflect the history of life&#8217;s transit from anaeroby
to aeroby. I will discuss this and other falsifiable predictions from the
model that sex is the "missing link&#8217; in cell evolution from pro-karya to
eukarya. </p>

Apes</font> </p>
 
<p>About 80% of the world's gorillas and a slightly lower proportion of the 
world's chimpanzees are thought to live in two countries, Gabon and the Republic 
of Congo. My talk will discuss results from a new, largescale survey dataset 
that suggest a catastrophic decline of apes in Gabon over the last 18 years. 
The commercial trade in bushmeat appears to be the primary cause of decline 
but several lines of evidence suggest that the ebola virus has also had a 
major impact. I'll discuss this evidence and also some modeling I'm currently 
in the midst of suggesting that differences between gorillas and chimps in 
social group structure influence ebola transmission dynamics, with potentially 
major impacts on group size distribution, sex ratio, and population resilience. 
If additional data from several collaborators arrive in time, I will throw 
out some seat of the pants estimates on the rate of spatial spread of ape 
deaths. These estimates may help discriminate between primary transmission 
from reservoir and secondary transmission between apes as major causes of 
ebola outbreaks in apes. If time remains, the talk will end with some rank 
speculation about the role that changes in the spatial grain of human settlement 
(i.e. urbanization) may have played in the emergence of ebola as an important 
disease in gorillas, chimpanzees, <br>
 and humans. <br>

<p>I will be talking about the linkage between pelagic and benthic ecosystems.
 These two different places function as home for two <br>
 different stages of an invertebrate life-cycle. Adults live on shore competing 
for space while juveniles life in the water column. In up-welling ecosystems, 
the exchange between benthic and costal populatios is episidic and stochastic---up-welling 
intensity and frequeny. </p>
 
<p>Together with my collaborator, Bernardo Broitman, at UCSB, we have been
 developing theoretical models about the demographic scenario described above 
as well as analysing satellite image data from near shore sea variables (temperature,

<p><font color="#000099">Evolutionary branching and resource adaptation</font> 
 </p>
 
<p>I developed a framework for studying evolutionary branching of multiple
 <br>
 species with multiple traits using the adaptive dynamics method, and applied
 <br>
 it to study the evolution of&nbsp; resource adaptation. I introduced a <br>
 "double-dimension method" to study the branching conditions for both <br>
 multiple-species systems with a single trait per species and systems with
 <br>
 multiple traits per species. The branching conditions comprise a coexistence
 <br>
 condition for mutants and their parents, and a saddle condition of the <br>
 evolutionary equilibrium in the "doubled" system. The multiple-trait&nbsp;
systems <br>
 present more complexities than the single-trait-per-species systems because
 <br>
 in multiple-trait systems the branched species have random combinations
of  <br>
 the branched traits. I then applied this framework to&nbsp; study the adaptation
 <br>
 to both continuously distributed and discrete resources. In both cases I
<br>
 showed that evolutionary branching may occur if there are constraints on 
the <br>
 resource utilization ability, so that multiple consumers with specialist
<br>
 strategies for partitioning the resource distribution can evolve. Large
<br>
 switching costs prevent consumers from branching and promote one specialist
 <br>
 strategy. But even with large switching costs a consumer may adapt to <br>
 extremely different resources either by branching through intermediate <br>
 resources or by draining the original resource so that switching to the
<br>
 alternative is beneficial. <br>

<p><font color="#000099">Seed dispersal as a cause of aggregation in tropical
 trees</font> <br>
 &nbsp; </p>
 
<p>It has often been speculated that limited seed dispersal leads to clumping
 <br>
 in tree populations, but this has never been directly demonstrated. <br>
 Interactions between dispersal and post-dispersal processes affecting <br>
 seedling and sapling survival, such as density dependence, facilitation,
<br>
 and habitat associations, could in theory lead to a host of different <br>
 spatial distributions of juvenile and adult trees.&nbsp; In spite of this, 
I <br>
 show that dispersal syndromes are broadly correlated with spatial <br>
 dispersion in a diverse tree community in Malaysia. </p>
 
<p>In order to determine the extent to which clumping is explained by seed
 <br>
 dispersal, I measured dispersal in five highly aggregated understory <br>
 species, and used these data to parameterize simulations of dispersal, <br>
 recruitment and death over multiple generations.&nbsp; Simulations predicted
 <br>
 dispersions very close to those observed in four of five species. </p>
 
<p>Further tests were required to eliminate alternative mechanisms leading
 to <br>
 clumping: associations with patchy habitats, and facilitation. I <br>
 manipulated seedlings in the field, and measured effects of neighbors on
<br>
 growth in saplings and adults of Mallotus penangensis, to show that for
at  <br>
 least this species, only seed dispersal adequately explains the <br>
 distribution. </p>
 
<p>Overall, these tests represent minimum requirements for quantifying the
 <br>
 contribution of dispersal to spatial dispersion.&nbsp; They could with relative
 <br>
 ease be modified to apply to species with strong post-dispersal <br>
 constraints, such as negative density dependence or habitat specificity.

<p><font color="#000099">What are porous genomes?</font> <br>
 <font color="#000099">And what do they mean for species, speciation, and 
phylogenetics?</font> </p>
 
<p>Wu (2001) recently drew attention to the porosity of the genome: when
<br>
 reproductive isolation is incomplete, lineages may remain distinct at <br>
 "speciation genes" while homogenizing at unlinked neutral genes.&nbsp; Using
 <br>
 simple analytical and more complex/realistic single-population models, I
<br>
 previously showed that some components of the genome (e.g., mtDNA) are <br>
 especially vulnerable to introgression from immigrants.&nbsp; I speculated
 that <br>
 the Lake Victoria cichlid flock could have resulted from low levels of <br>
 hybridization between several lineages during the re-founding of the lake,
 <br>
 rather than explosive radiation of a single lineage, as commonly believed.
 </p>
 
<p>In order to better consider the likelihood that introgression will mask
 the <br>
 diversity of founding lineages, I now investigate a stochastic, explicitly
 <br>
 genetic individual-based model.&nbsp; Here organisms mate assortatively
in  <br>
 ecologically divergent lineages.&nbsp; Surprisingly, such lineages are quite
 <br>
 likely to homogenize at some genes while maintaining their integrity at
<br>
 others.&nbsp; The conditions characteristic of habitat colonization further
 <br>
 facilitate homogenization.&nbsp; I conclude by discussing the ramifications
 for <br>
 the concepts of species and speciation, and the reconstruction of <br>
 phylogenies. <br>

 <font color="#180cf8">Invasion dynamics, attractor inheritance, and limiting 
similarity in</font> <br>
 <font color="#180cf8">evolution by small mutational steps</font> </p>
 
<p>In adaptive dynamics it is commonly assumed that if a mutant can invade
 <br>
 a resident population while invasion under reversal of roles (i.e., <br>
 with the resident as invader) is not possible, then the mutant will go <br>
 to fixation, i.e., the mutant will oust the resident and become the new
<br>
 resident itself. A second common assumption is that if the mutant can <br>
 invade, and invasion under reversal of roles is also possible, then the
<br>
 mutant and the resident will coexist as a protected dimorphism. <br>
 By means of examples I show that in general these assumptions need not <br>
 be true. I also show, however, that if the mutant and the resident have
<br>
 only slightly different phenotypes or "strategies", then these <br>
 assumptions are readily justified for a very large class of <br>
 deterministic as well as stochastic ecological models. This is done in <br>
 two steps: First I show that if the mutant is introduced in <br>
 sufficiently low numbers in a resident population close to a population
<br>
 attractor (equilibrium or limit cycle etc.), then the sum of the <br>
 resident and mutant population densities will stay arbitrarily close to
<br>
 the resident attractor. In other words, with initial conditions typical
<br>
 for an invasion event, the combined resident-mutant population dynamics
<br>
 stays inside a narrow tube-shaped region of the resident-mutant <br>
 population state space. Next, I show that coexistence inside this tube <br>
 is either not possible (one-dimensional strategies) or can be made <br>
 arbitrarily unlikely (multi-dimensional strategies) provided the mutant
<br>
 and resident strategies are sufficiently similar to one another but not
<br>
 too close to a so-called singular strategy, i.e., a strategy where <br>
 directional selection vanishes. I then continue to show that this <br>
 implies that almost everywhere in the strategy space, invasion by the <br>
 mutant implies fixation of the mutant and moreover such that the mutant
<br>
 stays on the same attractor as the former resident. The latter <br>
 phenomenon I call "attractor inheritance". <br>
 I conclude with two examples (evolutionary suicide and evolutionary <br>
 cycles) to demonstrate how these results can be applied to concrete <br>
 models. <br>

 <font color="#000099">Are forest fires HOT?</font> <br>
 &nbsp; </p>
 
<p>The catastrophic fires which have once again scorched US forests <br>
 underscore criticism that twentieth century wildfire (mis)management <br>
 disrupted nature's cycle of disturbance and renewal, leading to a <br>
 systematically increased risk and severity of large fires. This <br>
 real-world experience parallels debates involving abstract models <br>
 of forest fires which have become central metaphors for <br>
 illustrating universal features of complex systems. A popular link <br>
 between the worlds of real and model fires is the claim that both <br>
 exhibit roughly power law behavior in fire size versus frequency. <br>
 Two competing frameworks for power laws in complex systems apply <br>
 directly to forest fires. These are self-organized criticality <br>
 (SOC), which emphasizes fuel connectivity in random configurations <br>
 at a critical density, and highly optimized tolerance (HOT), which <br>
 emphasizes specialized high-density configurations which are tuned <br>
 for robustness in an uncertain environment. In this talk I use <br>
 observed statistics and fire scar shapes to (1) draw fundamental <br>
 distinctions between the SOC and HOT, and (2) evaluate the long <br>
 term effects of extreme weather and suppression in a detailed <br>
 high-fidelity forest fire simulation environment HFire. <br>
 Observations and the HFire simulations are both in striking <br>
 agreement with an abstract model based on HOT. This work suggests that <br>
 identifying robustness tradeoffs which underlie resilience in <br>
 different fire regimes may be key to understanding the long term <br>
 evolution of forest ecosystems, and evaluating sensitivities to <br>
 climate change and forest management strategies. <br>

<p><font color="#000099">Behavioral and landscape effects on redistribution
 kernels: some theory,</font> <br>
 <font color="#000099">some data</font> </p>
 
<p>Movement behavior affects the way in which individuals redistribute <br>
 themselves over space and thus has the potential to affect many ecological
 <br>
 processes. Over limited time scales the movement of an individual can <br>
 often be characterized by relatively simple mathematical models. Examples
 <br>
 of such models include biased random walks and correlated random walks.
<br>
 Over longer time-scales these simple models often fail to describe <br>
 patterns of movement because of the likelihood that the individual changes
 <br>
 its movement behavior (for example as a result of entering a different <br>
 habitat type). One way to accommodate these multiple behaviors is to <br>
 develop different movement models for a number of discrete movement <br>
 states. Analysis of simple models suggests that the redistribution kernel
 <br>
 of an individual moving according to different behaviors is related to the
 <br>
 total time spent in each movement state. This in turn depends on the <br>
 internal state dynamics of the individual and the structure of the <br>
 landscape. I will discuss ideas to approximate the results of this <br>
 interaction between behavior and landscapes. On the data side of my talk,
 <br>
 I will present Bayesian methods for partitioning elk movements into <br>
 different states based on ordered series of step lengths and turning <br>
 angles. This approach includes a method for estimating the switching rates
 <br>
 between movement states. Furthermore, landscape data can be integrated <br>
 into this approach to test whether certain landscape features are <br>
 associated with movement state transitions. </p>

<p>Influenza is a strongly seasonal disease which is directly and indirectly
 responsible for a <br>
 large amount of mortality.&nbsp; Estimates of the total mortality burden
due to influenza in the <br>
 United States range from a few thousand people per year up to around a million 
people per <br>
 year.&nbsp; I will discuss some ongoing efforts to understand the seasonality
 and the mortality <br>
 burden of flu. </p>

<p><font color="#000099">Spatial heterogeneity versus temporal fluctuation
 versus species coexistence</font> </p>
 
<p>We study the effect of permanent spatial heterogeneity on species <br>
 coexistence in a lottery-competition model.&nbsp; The system consists of
<br>
 multiple habitats, each composed of a number of sites occupied by adults
of  <br>
 two species.&nbsp; Larvae (or seeds) produced from different habitats are 
mixed <br>
 in a common pool.&nbsp; When an adult dies, the vacant site is filled by 
an <br>
 individual randomly chosen from the larval (or seed) pool.&nbsp; We can
identify  <br>
 all the equilibria and their stability.&nbsp; If there are n habitats, there 
can <br>
 be up to n + 1 equilibria, and about half of them are locally stable.&nbsp;
Our <br>
 main result is that the between-habitat variation in the adult mortality
<br>
 promotes the coexistence, but that in the larval production rate (or seed
 <br>
 production rate) discourages the coexistence.&nbsp; This conclusion is opposite
 <br>
 to the role of temporal variation in the standard lottery model, in which
 <br>
 the between-year variation in the reproductive rate promotes coexistence
of  <br>
 competitors, but that in the adult mortality discourages the coexistence.
 <br>
 Next we study the fraction of randomly formed pairs of species that can
<br>
 coexist.&nbsp; Species can coexist more easily for larger spatial heterogeneity
 <br>
 and smaller temporal fluctuation of adult mortality and for smaller spatial
 <br>
 heterogeneity and larger temporal fluctuation of larval (seed) production
 <br>
 rate.&nbsp; In general, in maintaining the diversity of species, the spatial
 <br>
 heterogeneity might be more likely to be important than temporal <br>
 fluctuation of the environment -- because [1] incomplete mixing of seeds 
or <br>
 larval encourage the coexistence by spatial heterogeneity but not that by
 <br>
 temporal fluctuation, and [2] temporal fluctuation lottery model can work
 <br>
 only when the adult mortality is low, but the spatial heterogeneity model
 <br>
 can work irrespective of the absolute magnitude of mortality. <br>

 &nbsp; </p>
 
<p>Size-selective harvesting in wild fish populations results in selection
 <br>
 pressure for earlier maturation, which reduces the biomass yield and <br>
 sustainability of fisheries.&nbsp; Marine reserves may counter this negative
 <br>
 effect, and my talk will focus on a model that addresses how marine <br>
 reserve design impacts the potential for marine reserves to reduce <br>
 selection for earlier maturation in harvested fish.&nbsp; In this model,
I  <br>
 represent size at maturation as a quantitative genetic trait and <br>
 evaluate how marine reserve size, spacing, amount of take allowed <br>
 affects the evolution of size at maturation.&nbsp; To conclude, I will <br>
 present three possible extensions to the model, which is currently in <br>
 progress. <br>

 Some traits reflect a trade off between short term and long term<br>
 survival of the lineage carrying them. How is the balance determined?<br>
 The answer depends on the evolutionary rate of change of those traits.<br>
 Faster evolving ones will evolve to invest more in the short term and<br>
 less in the long term than slower evolving ones. I will try to explain<br>
 how this result comes by and discuss its meaning in the context of<br>
 evolutionary theory.<br>
