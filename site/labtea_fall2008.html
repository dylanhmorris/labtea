the formation of patterns in desert vegetation<br>
</b><i>Daniel Stanton</i><br>
I will be presenting the still rather preliminary work that Liliana Salvador and 
I have been doing on self-organizing pattern formation associated with fog. &nbsp;We 
have been constructing a model of spatial patterns of what may be one of the 
simplest ecosystems around, bromeliad fields that live off of fog in rain-less 
areas of the Atacama desert. &nbsp;We aim to show how directional flow of fog is 
sufficient to generate the striking banding patterns observed at some sites in 
Peru and Chile. &nbsp;I will also present some work on a similar model of forest 
fragment dynamics in a fog-forest in Chile, in which we have begun to 
incorporate some fluid dynamic.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Adaptation under molecular clock<br>
</b><i>Sergey Kryazhimskiy<br>
</i>The observation that the rates of evolution at the protein level are 
approximately constant with time at long timescales (the so called &quot;molecular 
clock&quot;) was one of the major arguments presented in the 60-ies by Kimura in 
favor of the neutral theory. Three decades later, a remarkable constancy of 
amino acid substitution rates is confirmed by direct observation in the 
long-term evolutionary experiments in E. coli in Rich Lenski's lab. The caveat 
is, however, that the neutral theory is out of question: the observed 
substitutions are highly adaptive. In this talk I will discuss a potential 
explanation for how adaptation can proceed under molecular clock.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>A neutral theory of biological invasions<br>
</b><i>Ryan Chisholm</i></font><br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">Biological invasions threaten native biodiversity 
and human welfare, but they also provide invaluable insights into ecology, 
evolution and biogeography. &nbsp;The study of biological invasions has been 
criticised for its lack of general principles. &nbsp;At a previous lab tea, I 
proposed a neutral theoretical framework as a null model of biological invasions 
against which specific hypotheses can be tested. &nbsp;In this week's lab tea I will 
discuss ongoing development of the theory and compare the theoretical 
predictions to data from invasions of temperate forests and grasslands.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Foraging strategies and primate grouping 
patterns: “Not all who wander are lost”<br>
</b><i>Liliana Salvador</i><br>
</font><font size="2" face="Arial">Animals move to explore their environment, to 
search for food and to find mates, constantly making decisions about when and 
where to go. The success of these routine activities depends on the searching 
strategies that the animals adopt. From field data, there is evidence that 
foraging animal groups have preference for specific sites, returning to them 
after a time period. This indicates that they have both “cognitive maps” of the 
position of the resource patches, and “episodic memory” which allows them to 
remember past resource values and to predict future ones. There is also evidence 
that they share their search space with other groups, creating a contact network 
of overlapping home ranges. Despite a vast literature describing the statistical 
patterns of home range usage, very little research has addressed the behavioral 
mechanisms through which home range patterns emerge. To address these questions, 
I have been developing a spatially explicit foraging model using primates as a 
model system. With this model I show that the use of sophisticated cognitive 
skills leads to the spontaneous self-organization of home range behavior.</font></p>

</b><i>Carey Nadell<br>
</i></font><font size="2" face="Arial">Bacteria predominantly reside in densely packed, surface-bound 
communities known as biofilms. While living in groups, many microbial species 
also secrete compounds that affect the reproductive success of their neighbors. 
Predominant examples of such secreted products include nutrient-sequestering 
compounds and digestive enzymes, some of which are virulence factors for 
pathogenic bacteria. I will present the preliminary results of a model exploring 
the evolution of cooperative exo-product secretion in biofilms.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Novel insights and predictions about the 
structure of forests across fertility and disturbance gradients&nbsp;</b></font><br>
<font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Ray Dybzinski&nbsp;</i></font><br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">Before I arrived at Princeton, several members of 
the Pacala lab made, in my estimation, a tremendous advance in our understanding 
of height-structured competition for light with both the creation and testing of 
an analytically tractable, mean field model of forest dynamics. Last Spring, I 
presented my contribution to that model, which consists of adding a mechanistic 
link between capture of soil nutrients and growth rates of trees in the canopy 
and the understory. I will review the model and then present several of its 
interesting insights and predictions. ESS strategies are predicted to be 
“rootier” in areas of either lesser fertility or greater disturbance. The model 
permits invasion of sufficiently similar strategies, but sufficiently dissimilar 
strategies are founder controlled. Importantly, and in contrast to many of the 
predictions made by earlier models that use less sophisticated light 
competition, good nutrient competitors are never predicted to coexist with good 
light competitors because each must go through a life history stage (understory 
or canopy) in which it is limited by the resource for which it is the better 
competitor. Moreover, there is a suggestion that species that may initially 
dominate a site via founder control may “engineer” nutrient availability via 
litter chemistry so that they are the ESS. The model also makes predictions 
about the grassland/forest boundary: At low nutrients and with increasing 
disturbance, no closed-canopy ESS “rootiness” is predicted; rather, rootier 
strategies invade and drive the system into open canopy. Open-canopy “rootiness” 
is much greater than any closed-canopy strategy and does not vary with fertility 
or disturbance (although total canopy area does).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A metacommunity perspective on forest dynamics</b></font><br>
<font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Jeremy Lichstein</i></font><br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">We have developed a model of forest dynamics that is 
simple enough so that<br>
many aspects of the model's behavior can be described analytically, yet<br>
realistic enough to make useful predictions about real forest communities.<br>
I am developing a metacommunity version of this model to explore how habitat<br>
loss and inter-patch dispersal rates affect local (within-patch) species<br>
diversity. &nbsp;I would like to tell you about it. &nbsp;The modeling framework is<br>
similar to that described by Ray Dybzinski in last week's labtea. &nbsp;Because I<br>
have fewer and less cool results than Ray, I will spend some time walking<br>
through some of the basic building-blocks of the model.</font></p>

distributions and vegetation structure shifts: building the first analytical and 
mechanistic model of biome distributions<br>
</b><i>Caroline Farrior</i><b><br>
</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">The distribution of biomes can largely be 
explained using only a few climatic variables.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this pattern is 
considered one of few ecological laws, we have no quantitative, mechanistic 
explanation for the specific transitions between biomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pacala research 
group has designed a model of forest dynamics governed by macroscopic equations 
that predict the outcome of height-structured competition from plant vital 
rates. During the past year, I worked to incorporate physiological models of 
light and water limited photosynthesis into the vital rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have been 
able to do this in a way that maintains analytical tractability, we now have a 
prediction for competitive ability as a function of plant physiological traits 
and environmental conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I will present a plan for extending this 
model of forest dynamics into a treatment of general vegetation and analytic 
tools that will determine the late-successional dominant plant types across the 
globe.</font></p>

</b>
<i>Mark Laidre</i></font><br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">This talk will attempt to stimulate some 
constructive gossip about the topic of gossip. It will explore, in particular, 
the prospects for modeling networks of gossiping human agents who signal to one 
another in the context of an evolutionary game. I will begin by providing a 
sampling of some of the intriguing empirical patterns from the social sciences 
literature as well as from studies of our closest primate relatives. These 
empirical patterns will then be used to sketch a step-by-step framework for an 
agent-based simulation of gossip, focusing specifically on how gossip can remain 
reliable over evolutionary time. This is a brand new project, somewhat 
tangential to the rest of my thesis work, so I’ll be extremely grateful for any 
general feedback on the ideas as well as more specific discussion about some of 
the thornier compromises between realism and tractability.</font></p>

  savanna? A case for climate, soil resources and disturbance<br>
  </b><i>Carla Staver</i></font><br>
  <font size="2" face="Arial">On a broad scale, how do climate and nutrient 
  conditions of a savanna determine how disturbance impacts on vegetation 
  dynamics? Higgins et al. (2000) consider the impacts of fire on tree cover, 
  which can undoubtedly be significant (Bond et al. 2005). While herbivory and 
  fire are often discussed as key local disturbances that act on an 'abiotic 
  template' (Scholes &amp; Archer 1997), the interactions of fire and herbivory with 
  that template are rarely explicitly considered. Local climate and soil 
  resources strongly influence many ecological processes in savannas--including 
  rates of tree and grass growth, herbivore use, and the probability and extent 
  of fires--but the ways in which these processes interact to affect vegetation 
  structure in savannas is largely unknown.</font><br>
